            <p>This is not an exhaustive list, but does include most of the 
			commonly used fields. Some fields can be set by any user, some can 
			be set only by analysts in that Domain , and some are set by tBits 
			Collabwrite. Fields that cannot be set by users are greyed out in 
			the user interface. Refer to the <a href="#Permissions">Permissions</a>
                section for more details of access to Document fields.
</p>
            <p>A <em>list type</em> field has predefined values which you can 
			select. For example, the Severity values are typically Critical, 
			High, Medium, and Low. </p>
            <p>Document fields can be configured to the needs of a particular 
			Domain , both with respect to the exact values permitted for a 
			field, as well as which fields are defined. For instance, the 
			Category field has different defined values depending on the domain. 
			Some domains have extra fields (or <em>custom fields</em>). For 
			example, the Proprietary Domain has fields to track the estimated 
			and actual time to complete the task.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    The <em>Category</em> and <em>Document Type</em>
                	are used by the analysts in a domain to manage the kinds of 
					Documents which they receive and need to act on. In general, 
					the category is used to express the part of the application 
					which should be addressed if the domain is for a product, 
					and the groups with which the domain works if the domain 
					provides a service, and the Document type is used to express 
					the sort of action that needs to be taken. For example, the 
					categories for a product could include Database, Scripts, 
					Server and Web UI. The Document types could include Bug, 
					Development, Issue, and QA.</li>
                <li>
                    The <em>Status</em>
                	is used to track the progress of a Document, for instance, 
					from Pending to Open to Active to Awaiting Response or 
					Pending QA to Closed. The exact statuses in use vary between 
					Domains .</li>
                <li>
                    The <em>Severity</em>
                	can be set by the Logger of a Document to indicate the 
					urgency of the problem presented in the Document.</li>
                <li>
                    The <em>Logger</em>, <em>Assignee</em>, and <em>Subscribers</em> 
					are all fields which take user IDs. The difference between 
					adding a user to the Subscriber list and to the CC list is 
					that the Subscriber is a perpetual assignment, and the CC a 
					one-time assignment: that is, someone added in the CC field 
					for an update to a Document will receive email for that 
					update only, and not on subsequent updates. The subscribers 
					receive all email associated with that Document.

            <h4 id="ColorIntBits">Color in tBits Collabwrite</h4>
            <p>tBits Collabwrite uses color to notify you of the status of 
			Documents and updates. Document updates can be outlined in one of 
			three colors:</p>

            <ul>
              <li>The outline color of new updates is ochre: <span style="color: rgb(179, 143, 0);">
				new update color</span></li>
			  <li>The outline color of updates which you have read is grey: <span style="color: rgb(217, 217, 217);">
				read update color</span> </li>
              <li>The outline color of the first update is the Domain theme 
				color. The default theme color is blue: <span style="color: rgb(102, 121, 179);">
				default Domain theme color</span> </li>
            </ul>
            <p>The Domain theme color is also used for headers in the web 
			interface; for example, the <a href="http://tbits.tbitsglobal.com/search/Sys" target="_blank">
			Systems</a> Domain has defined an unusual theme color. </p>
            <p>If a Document has a severity of Critical, the Document number is 
			displayed in bold font and red color.</p>
            <p>The outline colors actually used depend on whether you are using 
			the email or the web interface, and on whether you have set the 
			Domain to track read and unread Documents for you.</p>
            <ul>
              <li>In email:
                <ul>
                  <li>The most recent update is always outlined in the new 
					update color.</li>
                  <li>The first update is outlined in the Domain theme color.</li>
                  <li>Other updates between the first and the most recent are 
					outlined in grey.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>In the web interface:
                <ul>
                  <li>All unread updates are outlined in the new update color.</li>
                  <li>The first update, if read, is outlined in the Domain theme 
					color. </li>
                  <li>Other read updates are outlined in grey.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>There are also colors used to convey the severity of a Document 
			when <a href="#Export">exporting to Excel</a>. </p>

            </h2>
            <p><a name="Instances"></a>The Document system web interface can be 
			accessed from intranet/intranet pages. </p>
            <p>The default page is the <a href="#MyRequests">My Documents</a> 
			page. The main page includes several option tabs for <a href="#SearchResults">
			searching for Documents</a> in tBits Collabwrite, and there is a 
			separate form for <a href="#Logging">submitting a new Document</a>. </p>
            <p>The <strong>My Documents</strong> page shows Documents with which 
			you are associated across all Domains in that tBits Collabwrite 
			database. The <strong>
                    Search</strong> interface allows you to find Documents based 
			on the subject, text, or any of the fields associated with a 
			particular Document. The <strong>Add Document</strong> page allows 
			you to select a Domain and set various fields when entering a new 
			Document in a Domain . The web interface also gives you control over 
			whether email notification should be sent in response to this 
			update, and if so, to whom it should be sent.
            </p>
            <p>
                For the fields which take email IDs, you can click on the <strong>
				Assignee</strong>,
                <strong>CC</strong>, <strong>Logger</strong>, or <strong>
				Subscriber</strong> label and select an email ID. <a name="Autocomplete"></a>
				If you enter a part of the email ID for a user, the auto 
				complete function causes all available matching IDs to be 
				displayed. As in Outlook, you can also use <strong>Ctrl-K</strong> 
				to auto complete a partially entered email ID.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                If you type text in one of these fields, tBits Collabwrite 
				provides a best-matched drop down hint list from among all the 
				users and mailing lists present in the database in the format &quot;DisplayName 
				&lt;user_ID &gt;&quot; or &quot;LastName FirstName &lt;user_ID&gt;&quot;.</li>
                <li>
                    auto complete matching is based on the first name, the last 
					name, or the email address. So, for example, if you type <em>
					john</em>, you will be presented with users for whom the 
					first name, the last name, or the email ID starts with <em>
					john</em>.</li>
                <li>
                Use tab or enter to complete the email ID from the selected hint 
				list.</li>
                <li>
                    Semicolon (;) and comma (,) are delimiters between email 
					IDs.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>The auto complete for Assignee considers only the <a href="#AdministratorsRoles">
			category Assignee</a> for that category and Domain .</p>
            <p><a name="BusinessAreaToolTip"></a>You can see some information 
			about the Domain by holding the mouse over the Domain name in the 
			web interface, including the prefix, the mailing list, and the

			valid descriptors for the Domain . </p>
            <h3><a name="PreservingData"></a>Preserving Data On Changing Domains </h3>
            <p>On changing Domains in the Add New Document window or in the

            <p>On adding a new Document, some of the text fields are preserved:

            <p>In the normal Search interface, </p>
            <ul>
              <li>The CC, Subscriber, Logger, and Updated By fields are 
				preserved. The state of the <strong>Last Updated By</strong>

				checked, and if it was off, it will still be off.</li>
              <li>The search text and the selection of where to search are 
				preserved; that is, in Subject, in All Text, and so on. </li>
              <li>If you select <strong>All</strong> for the Category, Document 
				Type, Severity, or Status, that value is retained on changing

            </ul>
            <p>In the Advanced Search interface, the entered query is preserved. </p>
            <p>In a future version tBits Collabwrite will save other fields as

            <h2><a name="EmailInterface"></a>Email Interface
            </h2>
            <p>Email from MS Outlook can be used to log a new Document or reply 
			to a Document. When submitting a Document, one must know the email 
			ID for the Domain in question. </p>
            <p>One can set the following fields using the email interface:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Subject</strong>: The subject of the mail message 
					becomes the subject of the Document.</li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Body</strong>: The body of the message becomes the 
					body of the Document.</li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Severity</strong>: The default severity is medium. 
					The severity can be increased using the exclamation point 
					icon <img src="tbits-help_files/HighSeverity.gif" width="14" height="21">
                    in Outlook. The severity can be decreased using the down 
					arrow icon <img src="tbits-help_files/LowSeverity.gif" width="21" height="21">
                    in Outlook. The exact mapping of these Outlook settings to 
					tBits Collabwrite severities is configurable in each Domain, 
					so the high severity icon might map to High in one Domain 
					and Critical in another. You can also set the severity via <a href="#InlineUpdateCommands">
                        IUCs</a>.</li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Subscribers</strong>: Any user added in the <strong>
					To:</strong> field of a new Document Logger email becomes a 
					subscriber to that Document; a user in the <strong>CC:</strong> 
					field receives that message only, and not subsequent 
					replies. On replies to a Document, however, no subscribers 
					are added from the <strong>To:</strong>
                    or the <strong>CC:</strong>
                	fields of the email. If you specify other users on a reply, 
					they receive only that mail message.
				<p><strong>Note:</strong> To avoid sending duplicate email, use 
				the <a href="#InlineUpdateCommands">IUC</a> /sub or /cc in the 
				body of the message rather than using the <strong>To:</strong> 
				or <strong>CC:</strong> field in email. </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Attached</strong> <strong>files</strong>: Any files 
					attached to the email message are attached to the Document 
					as well.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>You can set or update other fields via the web interface; 
			alternatively, you can set them within the description text or via 
			email using <a href="#InlineUpdateCommands">IUCs</a>.
            </p>
            <p>To update a Document about which tBits Collabwrite sent you 
			email, simply reply to the email. An update to a Document which 
			involves only text and file attachments can be submitted with a 
			simple email reply. tBits Collabwrite email relating to Document 
			activity includes a hyperlinked Document number and has the same

                The header of an Outlook reply is not included in the Document

            <p>The tBits Collabwrite web interface keeps track of which 
			Documents have updates that you haven&#39;t viewed yet, and which

			bold text is the indicator, with a double-arrow icon <img src="tbits-help_files/new.gif" width="16" height="16"> 
			denoting a new Document. On the Document Details page, unviewed 
			updates are outlined in a different <a href="#ColorIntBits">color</a>. 
			tBits Collabwrite marks a Document or an update as <em>read</em>
                when you open it in the web interface as well as when you open 
			the corresponding email message.
            </p>
            <p>You can <a href="#ConfigureDialog">configure</a> the tracking of

            </p>
            <h3><a name="Logging"></a>Logging a New Document</h3>
            <p>The <strong>Add Document</strong> option is available from all 
			the interface pages in tBits Collabwrite. When adding (or 
			submitting) a new Document you should do the following:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                Identify the correct Domain for the Document. Select the correct 
				Domain before entering information about the Document, as most 
				fields are cleared on <a href="#PreservingData">changing Domain </a>
				. Only Subject, Description, Subscribers, Cc, and Summary are 
				not cleared.</li>
                <li>
                If it is possible that there might already be notification about 
				this problem, such as &quot;The UNIX Chooser is not working this 
				morning&quot;, search among the existing Documents to determine 
				whether it is necessary to add a new Document. If a Document has 
				already been logged, you can reply to that one giving the 
				details you have observed. If not, you can add a new Document.</li>
                <li>
                Specify a subject which summarizes the problem.</li>
                <li>
                Give a clear description of the Document.</li>
                <li>
                If it would help to clarify the problem, for example in a bug 
				report, attach a file.</li>
                <li>
                    Specify a <a href="#Prioritization">severity</a>
                	for the Document. The default severity is medium.</li>
                <li>
                    If appropriate, specify subscribers, a due date and time, 
					whether the Document is private to the analysts for that 
					Domain , and any other characteristics of that Domain which 
					apply.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>On submitting a Document, tBits Collabwrite sends email to the 
			logger, subscribers, Assignees and CC entries, and to the analysts 
			associated with that Domain ; these details are <a href="#CustomizingDomain">
			configurable</a> for the Domain .
            </p>
            <p>Most of the options which are available on updating a Document 
			are available when a Document is submitted as well. For instance, <a href="#PrivateRequests">
			marking a Document as private</a>, specifying a category if you are 
			an analyst for that Domain , using <a href="#SmartTags">smart tags</a>, 
			using <a href="#InlineUpdateCommands">
                    IUCs</a> when submitting a Document, etc. If you do not have 
			access to modify a field, then that field is grayed out in the 
			interface. </p>
            <p>If the email ID of another tBits Collabwrite Domain is specified 
			in the <strong>CC: </strong>
			field using the web interface, the Document is submitted in the 
			other Domain as well, and the two Documents are linked; see the 
			description of
<a href="#LinkedRequests">
                    linked Documents</a>. This is true for new Documents as well 
			as for updates to existing Documents.
            </p>
            <p>Note that tBits Collabwrite displays the text of your Document in 
			a fixed width font, so you can make use of newlines and spaces to 
			create well-formatted Documents. A future version of tBits 
			Collabwrite will support the Rich Text format.
            </p>
            <h3><a name="Prioritization"></a>Prioritizing Documents</h3>
            <p>When you log a Document, it&#39;s important to assign it an 
			appropriate severity code to indicate the degree of urgency. Please 
			use the following guidelines:
            </p>
            <blockquote>

			</blockquote>
            <p><b>Note:</b> Sometimes your Documents may be re-prioritized 
			depending on current workload and other outstanding Documents.</p>
            <h3><a name="Updating"></a>Updating a Document</h3>
            <p>In many cases, the update to a Document is a reply: one submits a 
			response to the Document without changing any of the Document 
			fields. To do this, one can use the email or the web interface to 
			tBits Collabwrite. For any other kind of update, use the web 
			interface, or see a description of additional support for inline and 
			email updates via <a href="#InlineUpdateCommands">IUCs</a> below. To 
			use the web interface, open the Document using the link from the 
			tBits Collabwrite-generated email about this Document, or by 
			searching for the Document in the web interface. Click <strong>
			Update Document </strong>and then you are able to add text, edit the 
			subject, and change other fields of the Document. Even the Logger 
			can be changed in some cases. For example, you can add or update a 
			summary, associate a parent with this Document, link a similar 
			Document to this Document, close the Document, change field values, 
			and suppress email all in the same update.
            </p>
            <p>This interface also has an <a href="#ParentSubRequests">Add 
			Review</a> and an <a href="#Logging">Add Document</a> option.</p>
            <p>Email is always sent to the Assignee, unless the Assignee has <a href="#SettingsDialog">
			disabled email</a>. Other email options can be set by the 
			administrator of the Domain , and can be customized for particular 
			updates with the <strong>send email</strong> checkbox .
            </p>
            <h3><a name="PrivateRequests"></a>Private Documents
            </h3>
            <p>Documents can be marked as <em>private</em>. Only analysts for 
			the Domain can view private Documents. There can also be private 
			categories and private Domains in tBits Collabwrite; all of these 
			are indicated by a dagger icon: <img src="tbits-help_files/private_big.gif" width="16" height="16"></p>
            <p>The permissions associated with a private Document are considered 
			in the context of your relationship to that Document. A Document is 
			displayed in the search results if you have permission to view the 
			Document:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                by virtue of your association with the Domain ; e.g. your role 
				as an analyst in that Domain .</li>
                <li>
                    by virtue of the contextual role you have for that Document; 
					e.g. your role as the Logger or as an Assignee for the 
					Document.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>For example, if a Domain allows subscribers to view private 
			Documents, you can view Documents for which you are a subscriber 
			even if your status in that Domain would otherwise not allow you 
			view permission for that Document.
            </p>
            <h3><a name="Drafts"></a>Drafts</h3>
            <p>You can save drafts of Document updates in progress and reload 
			them at a later time. You can also configure tBits Collabwrite to 
			autosave drafts of your updates at fixed time intervals using the <a href="#SettingsDialog">
			Settings</a> page. The primary purpose of this feature is to avoid 
			losing updates in progress if you accidentally close a browser 
			window or if your browser crashes.</p>
            <p>
            The saved drafts are available from all pages. </p>
            <p>The following fields are saved in drafts:</p>

            <h3><a name="Summaries"></a>Remarks</h3>
            <p>
                A summary can be added for a Document from the Add Document or 
				the Update Document page. Click <strong>Summary</strong>, enter 
				the summary text, and click <strong>Submit</strong>. The summary 
				is displayed with a grayed-out background at the top of the 
				Document Details page. This is especially useful for Documents 
				with many replies.
            </p>
            <h3><a name="ParentSubRequests"></a>Parents and Reviews</h3>
            <p>A Document can be associated with other Documents in a 
			parent/Review relationship. You can add a parent to a Document from 
			the <strong>Add Document</strong>
                page or the <strong>Update Document</strong> page by clicking 
			the <strong>Parent</strong>
                option; that is, the parent can be added either to a new or 
			existing Document. To remove the relationship to this Document, 
			click <strong>Parent</strong> on the <strong>Update Document</strong> 
			page and enter 0.
            </p>
            <p>From the Document Details page, click <strong>Add Review</strong> 
			to log a new Review of the Document you are reading. The <strong>Add 
			Document</strong> 
                form will open with the <strong>Parent</strong> field filled in.
            </p>
            <p>To create a parent/Review relationship for two existing 
			Documents, update the Review and add the parent reference. From a 
			parent, you can create a new Review but you cannot make a previously 
			existing Document a Review.
            </p>
            <p>If the Document you are looking at has a parent Document and that 
			parent has other Reviews, they are called <strong>Siblings</strong> 
			of the current Document. Note that a parent Document can have many 
			Reviews, but a Review can have only a single parent Document. 
			Reviews can have many sibling Documents as well.
            </p>
            <p>You can see parent and Review relationships in the <a href="#SearchResults">
			Search Results</a> page as well.</p>
            <p>More general links to Documents are supported as well; see the 
			description <a href="#LinkedRequests">
                    below</a>.</p>
            <h3><a name="SmartTags"></a>Smart Tags and Hyperlinks in Text
            </h3>
            <p>A smart tag is a notation that can be used in the body of a 
			Document to cause a hyperlink to a Document or to a particular reply 
			to a Document to be inserted in the text. Smart tags can be used 
			with both the email and web interfaces to tBits Collabwrite. Smart 
			tags are of the form <em>&lt;business_area_prefix&gt;#&lt;Document_number&gt;</em>. 
			Note that there <strong>cannot be any spaces</strong> within this 
			notation. So, for instance, <em>Sys#69080</em> refers to Document 
			number 69080 in the Systems Domain. This notation can be used in the 
			Document number field when using the search interface for tBits 
			Collabwrite, as well. There are tool tips over smart tags within 
			tBits Collabwrite which display the subject of the Document.            </p>
            <p>Within the body of a Document, tBits Collabwrite also allows you 
			to specify a URL for a Document, such as <em>http://tBits 
			Collabwrite/Q/Sys/69080</em>, and tBits Collabwrite converts this to 
			the text <em>Sys#69080</em> with a hyperlink to the Document.</p>
            <p>To link to a specific update within a Document, append &quot;#&quot; and 
			the update number: <em>
                    &lt;business_area_prefix&gt;#&lt;Document_number&gt;#&lt;update_number&gt;</em>. 
			So, for instance, <em>http://tBits Collabwrite/Q/GenDev/746#5</em> 
			or <em>GenDev#746#5</em>
                refers to update 5 for Document Number 746 in the General Domain 
			.
            </p>
            <p>The notation <em>Update#&lt;update_number&gt;</em> is linked to the 
			specified update number within the same Document. So <em>Update#6</em> 
			causes a link to the sixth update (or reply) to the current 
			Document. The notation <em>Document#&lt;Document_number&gt;</em> or <em>
			Req#&lt;Document_number&gt;</em> refers to a Document number within the 
			same Domain currently in use. </p>
            <p>In summary, you can use any of these notations to create a smart 
			tag:</p>
            <ul>
              <li> <em>&lt;business_area_prefix&gt;#&lt;Document_number&gt;<br>
                </em>For example, tBits Collabwrite turns <a href="http://tbits.tbitsglobal.com/Q/tBits/2675" target="_blank">
				tBits Collabwrite#2675</a> into a link to Document number 2675 
				in the tBits Collabwrite Domain . </li>
            <li><em>&lt;business_area_prefix&gt;#&lt;Document_number&gt;#&lt;update_number&gt;</em><br>
              For example, tBits Collabwrite turns <a href="http://tbits.tbitsglobal.com/Q/tBits/2675#1" target="_blank">
			tBits Collabwrite#2675#1</a> into a link to Document number 2675, 
			update 1, in the tBits Collabwrite Domain . </li>
            <li><em>Document#&lt;Document_number&gt;</em> or <em>Req#&lt;Document_number&gt;<br>
              </em>For example, tBits Collabwrite turns Document#325 or req#325 
			into a link to Document number 325 in the current Domain . </li>
            <li><em>Update#&lt;update_number&gt;</em><br>
              For example, tBits Collabwrite turns update#4 into a link to 
			update number 4 in the current Document.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Note that for other URLs, the method of making them a live link 
			is similar to Outlook. Specify <em>file://</em> and then the file 
			path:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    A URL starting with <em>http</em>: or <em>www</em></li>
                <li>
                    A file or directory on a mapped drive X: or Z:, such as <em>
					file://X:\infra\build\doc</em>
                    or <em>file://Z:\infra\build\doc\tBits Collabwrite.htm</em></li>
                <li>
                  UNC notation, such as <em>file://\\tbitsglobal.com\proj</em></li>
            </ul>
            <p>Enclose a URL in quotes or angle brackets (&quot;&quot; or &lt;&gt;) to insert 
			spaces or any special characters. For UNC paths, comma and semicolon 
			are delimiters between paths, as are spaces. For all others, spaces 
			or newlines are delimiters.</p>
            <p>The <em>file://</em>
			prefix is optional; you can substitute %20 for spaces. Within email, 
			there are a number of Outlook restrictions in the creation of 
			hyperlinks. </p>
            <h3><a name="LinkedRequests"></a>Linked Documents</h3>
            <p>tBits Collabwrite supports reciprocal links between similar 
			Documents: a Document can be linked to another Document in any 
			Domain . The relationship is transitive: that is, if Document A is 
			related to Document B, and Document B is related to Document C, then 
			Document A is also related to Document C.</p>
            <p>
                When viewing the Document Details page, one can view linked 
				Documents by putting the mouse over the <strong>Link Documents</strong>
				tag; hyperlinked references to the linked Documents then become 
				visible. There are tool tips over linked Documents within tBits 
				Collabwrite which display the subject of the Document.</p>
            <p>On submitting or updating a Document, click <strong>Link 
			Documents</strong> to specify Documents which are related to this. 
			Use <a href="#SmartTags">Smart Tags</a>
                to specify the linked Documents. If there are multiple 
			Documents, they can be separated with commas. For example, you can 
			specify:
            </p>
            <blockquote>Sys#3501, Sys#12305, Sys#3406#12</blockquote>
            <p>You cannot specify fully qualified URLs.
            </p>
            <p>If the email ID of another tBits Collabwrite Domain is specified 
			in the <strong>CC: </strong>
			field using the web interface, the Document is submitted in the 
			other Domain as well, and the two Documents are linked. </p>
            <p><a href="#ParentSubRequests">Parent Review relationships</a> are 
			also still supported in tBits Collabwrite, within the same Domain .
            </p>
            <h3><a name="PrimaryAssigned To"></a>Primary Assignee</h3>
            <p>As before, Documents can have multiple Assignees. It is possible 
			to designate one of multiple Assignees as <strong>primary</strong> 
			by putting a <strong>*</strong>
                before the email ID. This can help groups assign ultimate 
			responsibility to a single person.</p>
            <p>The My Documents tab of the Search interface can be changed to 
			select Documents for which you are the primary Assignee, in addition 
			to the other options (Logger, Assignee, subscriber, or any subset of 
			these). If you search based on your being the primary Assignee, the 
			results will also include Documents for which you are the only 
			Assignee.
            </p>
            <p>There can be only one primary Assignee. If multiple users are 
			specified as primary Assignee, only the first is selected.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Note</strong>: One cannot select Documents with a 
			specified primary Assignee from the other tabs of the Search 
			interface; only with the My Documents tab.</p>
            <h3><a name="TransferringRequests"></a>Transferring Documents to 
			Other Domains </h3>
            <p>    It is common for tBits Collabwrite Documents to be submitted 
			in the wrong Domain . The Document Details view includes a simple 
			option Transfer Document. Clicking on this causes a dialog to be 
			opened. Select the Domain to which the Document should be 
			transferred, enter any details required, and click Submit. The 
			information added in this dialog applies to the new Document. </p>
            <p>
The old Document is closed with text describing the transfer of the Document to 
a different Domain , and includes a smart link to the new Document. For the old 
Document, updates without any description or summary on the closed Document are 
allowed; no descriptions or summary changes are accepted. Any IUCs or email 
replies sent for the original Document are redirected to the new Document; this 
is done iteratively, should the original Document be transferred more than once. </p>
            <p>The new Document includes a smart link to the old Domain and all 
			the Document history from the original Document. The new Document is 
			Logger the original Submitter, but updated by the person who 
			transferred the Document.</p>
            <h3><a name="SimultaneousUpdates"></a>Conflict Resolution For 
			Simultaneous Document Updates</h3>
            <p>If two people try to update the fields of a Document at the same 
			time (e.g. to change the category or subject), the second person 
			gets a warning about the conflicts and is offered a resolution 
			method to avoid losing the first person&#39;s changes. There is a 
			Conflicting Updates dialog which offers you the opportunity to 
			review each conflict in field values before submitting your update 
			to the Document. The dialog lists the values that you have specified 
			for each field which is in conflict with another update. You can 
			view the newer updates by clicking on the links in the table, if you 
			wish.</p>
            <p>You can select each field value individually.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Click <strong>Submit</strong> to submit the update to the 
					Document with the values you have selected.                    <br>
              </li>
                <li>
                    Click <strong>Apply</strong> if you want to select values 
					for each field in the dialog and return to the Update 
					Document form for further modifications.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    In this case, the Update Document form will be updated with 
					the values you selected for the field values. You might want 
					to use this option if you wish to add to the description 
					text of the update.                    <br>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Click <strong>Cancel</strong> to return to the Update 
					Document page.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>Note that tBits Collabwrite does this checking only when an 
			update is submitted using the web interface; it does not check email 
			updates to Documents for conflicting simultaneous updates. If there 
			are simultaneous updates and the second is Logger email, it is 
			accepted as is. Therefore, caution should be exercised in the use of <a href="#InlineUpdateCommands">
			IUCs</a>.
            </p>
            <p>Also note that tBits Collabwrite does not check again for 
			conflicts when you click <strong>Submit</strong>, so it is possible 
			to fool the system, particularly if there is a long time interval 
			between opening the dialog and clicking <strong>Submit</strong>. 
			Similarly, if you click <strong>Apply</strong>, note that any 
			further changes you make in the Update Document form are not checked 
			for conflicts against updates by other users.
            </p>
            <p>Additionally, if a reply is sent via email to an earlier update, 
			then text is inserted next to the update number and email ID 
			identifying the update to which this is a response. For instance, if 
			there is an email reply to update 3, but there is also an update 4 
			recorded, the text &quot;[in reply to Update#3]&quot; is added in update 
			number 5. This helps to clarify the relationship between the 
			replies.</p>

            <p>The tBits Collabwrite <a href="#SearchLevels">Search interface</a> 
			has four tabs: Search, Advanced Search, All Domain Search, and My 
			Documents. From the Search interface, you can search for a Document 
			based on any of the Document fields or text stored for that 
			Document.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Note: </strong>First specify the Domain , as the fields 
			are cleared on changing Domains .
            </p>
            <p>If you specify a search string, it applies to the parts of the 
			Document specified, which can be selected from the pull-down menu to 
			the right of the search string. For example, you can specify the 
			subject, the summary, or all text. All words are &quot;and&quot;ed together; 
			that is, all the words specified must be present in the text for 
			search to select a Document. You can select values for any of the 
			Document fields as well. The various data you provide for the 
			Document fields are also &quot;and&quot; ed; that is, all must be present for 
			search to select a Document. You can search for any character within 
			the subject of a Document, but within the description of a Document, 
			only for alphanumeric characters. 
            </p>
            <p>You can click on <strong>Save Search…</strong> to save a search; 
			you then give it a name, which you can select later. The saved 
			search applies only to the Domain which was open when you saved the 
			search. This feature is described in detail <a href="#SavedSearches">
			below</a>.
            </p>
            <p>If you enter a number in the Document field, a Document in the 
			specified Domain is opened. If you know the Domain prefix and 
			Document number, you can specify the Domain prefix, then #, then a 
			Document number to display the Document without selecting the Domain 
			. For instance, you could have the Domain &#39;B&#39; open, but if you enter <em>
			A#123</em> in the Document field, then &#39;A&#39; Domain Document 123 is 
			opened. </p>
            <h3><a name="SearchLevels"></a><a name="SearchAllDomains"></a>Search 
			Interface Levels</h3>
            <p>There are three search levels to the search interface within the 
			tBits Collabwrite search tab: <b>Search</b>, <b>Advanced Search</b>, 
			and<b> <strong>All Domain Search</strong></b>. The default is 
			Search. You can access any level by clicking its name; the interface 
			expands or contracts to reflect your new choice. Note that for 
			Search or Advanced Search, first specify the Domain .
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <b>Search</b>
					is the default search level. It provides access to the most 
					important search fields: allowing you to search by Document 
					Number, by a search string, specifying what aspects of a 
					Document you want to search, and the Domain you want to 
					search. It also provides the ability to search by the 
					standard fields for all Domains , as well as by the person 
					who last updated the Document. <br>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Advanced Search</strong> is the most comprehensive 
					access level. It provides all of the access that <b>Search</b> 
					does, and adds the ability to search by the date and time 
					the Document was submitted and/or last updated as well as by 
					the custom fields for that Domain . It also includes a <a href="#QueryLanguage">
					TQL</a>
                    Builder. You can select the fields and values which you 
					would like to specify in your search, click <strong>Add to 
					Query</strong>, and the corresponding TQL is generated in 
					the text box below. Once your search expression is complete, 
					click <strong>Search</strong> to effect the search.
                    <br>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>All Domain Search </strong> allows a search of all

              </li>
                <li>
                    The <a href="#MyRequests">My Documents</a> tab of the Search

                <li>
                    For list type fields like the <strong>Category</strong> or <strong>

                <li>
                    For fields which take an email ID, such as the <strong>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    You can enter multiple Document numbers, Logger, Assignee, 
					subscribers, etc. by separating them with a comma or a 
					semicolon. tBits Collabwrite uses a comma to separate 
					entries within a field, so it will provide a new drop-down 
					selection menu for selecting a possible entry after each 
					semicolon or comma. Once you have clicked Search, it will 
					also understand entries separated by a comma or semicolon.<br>
                </li>
                <li>
                    If you enter &quot;&quot; (two double quotes with nothing between 
					them) into any search field, you will receive results whose 
					corresponding entries are blank. Note that if you just leave 
					a field blank, your search will simply ignore that field, 
					rather than return entries for which the entry is blank.
                    <br></li>
                <li>
                    You can use a comma (,) to escape auto completion if you 
					need to enter a value that does not exist in the list used 
					for auto completion (for example, finding Documents Assignee 
					users who no longer work here).
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h3><a name="SearchResults"></a>The Search Results Page
            </h3>
            <p>Each of the Document fields is displayed in a separate column. 
			Results are displayed by default in descending order of the Document 
			number; you can change this by clicking on the column header that 
			you want to use for sorting. An arrow is displayed in the column 
			header used for sorting; click on the arrow to toggle between 
			descending and ascending order, or click on a different column 
			header to sort by the value of that field. The Document numbers and 
			subjects have hyperlinks to the actual Document.
            </p>
            <p>The Search Results page has been designed to make it easy to 
			identify relevant Documents. For example:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Both the Document number and the subject text are 
					hyperlinked to the Document in the search results. In 
					addition, a context-sensitive menu appears when your mouse 
					is over a Document number, allowing you to view or update 
					the Document, or to add a Review.
                    <br></li>
                <li>
                    Both newly submitted and updated but not viewed Documents 
					are highlighted. By default,
                    <ul style="padding-top: 0cm;">
                        <li>
                        Newly submitted Documents are shown in bold text with a 
						double-arrowed icon at the beginning of the row: <img src="tbits-help_files/new.gif" width="16" height="16"></li>
                        <li>
                            Newly updated Documents are shown in bold text.</li>
                    </ul>
                    This is described <a href="#TrackingUnreadRequests">above</a>. 
					You can configure the tracking of read and unread Documents

					page.<br></li>
                <li>
                    You can change what fields are shown in your results and in 
					what order by clicking <b>Configure Search Results…</b> and 
					choosing what columns of data you would like to display. You 
					can also specify which field should be used for sorting the 
					results.
                    <br>
              </li>
                <li>
                    Each severity is associated with an <a href="#Legend">icon</a> 
					in the search results. The severity column header has an 
					icon similar to the MS Outlook importance flag. If a 
					Document has a severity of Critical, the Document number is 
					displayed in bold font and red color.<br></li>
                <li>
                    If a Document is past the due date, an alarm icon is 
					displayed to the right of the Document number: <img src="tbits-help_files/alarm_big.gif" width="16" height="16"><br>
                </li>
                <li><a name="ParentSubrequestTree"></a>
				If any of the matching Documents has parent Documents or 
				Reviews, all parent Documents are displayed, as are those 
				Reviews that match the search criteria, with the tree structure 
				of their relationships indicated. If the <img src="tbits-help_files/inc-hier.gif" style="margin-bottom: -5px;" width="16" height="16">
				icon is displayed, then there are Reviews which are not 
				displayed. Click on the icon to display the fully expanded tree.

              </li>
                <li>
                    You can display all Documents matching your search, 
					regardless of number, on one page. The default is to break 
					them up by a number specified as <strong>Results Per Page</strong> 
					within your <a href="#SettingsDialog">Settings</a> page. You 
					can check the <strong>List All </strong> checkbox on the 
					Search Results page to display all on a single page. 
					However, in the case of listing all Documents, there is a <a href="#SearchLargeNumbers">
					limit of 1000 results</a>; this is for performance reasons.
                    <br>
              </li>
                <li>
                    Access permissions affect the results you can see.

                    Private Documents, private categories, and private Domains 
					are indicated by a dagger icon: <img src="tbits-help_files/private_big.gif" width="16" height="16"><br>
                    <br>
                    The permissions associated with a private Document are 
					considered in the context of your relationship to that 
					Document. A Document is displayed in the search results if 
					you have permission to view the Document:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                        by virtue of your association with the Domain .</li>
                        <li>
                            by virtue of the contextual role you are in.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    For example, if a Domain allows subscribers to view private 
					Documents, you can view Documents for which you are a 
					subscriber even if your status in that Domain would 
					otherwise not allow you view permission for that Document.

                <li>
                    Search results are refreshed automatically. The duration

                <li>
                    If you have permission to set the status or severity of

            <h3><a name="SearchLargeNumbers"></a>Handling Large Numbers of 
			Search Results
            </h3>
            <p>Because retrieving a large number of search results is very 
			resource-intensive and can be quite slow, a search query retrieves 
			only the number of rows to be displayed in one page, but maintains 
			the count of Documents that actually matched the search criteria. 
			For example, if 2020 Documents match the search criteria and you 
			have selected 1000 results per page, then only the top 1000 results 
			are retrieved from the database and the result comment is <strong>1 
			- 1000 of 2020</strong>. If the matched Document count is less than 
			the number of Documents per page, say 550, then the result comment 
			is <strong>550 Documents matched</strong>.</p>
            <p>You can configure the number of search results to display on the <strong>
			Settings</strong>
                page.
            </p>
            <p>If you change the sorting of your search results by clicking on a 
			column header, tBits Collabwrite considers all Documents which match 
			the search criteria, not just those which were initially retrieved.

            </h3>
            <p>The Domain can also be configured to allow bulk Document updates.</p>
            <p>
                Conceptually, a bulk Document update moves a set of Documents to 
				a common state. For example,</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                Mark all QA-Reviewed Documents as Closed.</li>
                <li>
                    Mark all Documents in the &quot;Release&quot; category as Private.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>You can perform a bulk Document update if you are authorized to 
			change either the status or private field or both in a Domain . If 
			you are authorized to change those characteristics, you will see 
			checkboxes for selection to the left of the Document number in the 
			search results. One or more Documents can be selected to perform a 
			bulk Document update. Check the checkbox at the top of the column to 
			select all displayed Documents. Note that if there are multiple 
			pages of Documents, only those currently displayed are selected. </p>
            <p>You can mark a group of Documents as read or unread if you have <a href="#ConfigureDialog">
                    configured</a> the Domain to track read and unread 
			Documents.
            </p>
            <p>If bulk Document updates are allowed, then in the <a href="#SearchResults">
			Search Results page</a>, you can select a set of Documents by 
			checking the checkbox next to their description. Use the pull-down 
			menu to select the status you would like to apply to the selected 
			Documents; this will be one of
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                Closed</li>
                <li>
                Public</li>
                <li>
                Private</li>
                <li>
                Read</li>
                <li>Unread</li>
            </ul>
            <p>You can also add a custom description. Click <strong>Submit</strong> 
			to effect the change.</p>
            <p>An advanced bulk Document update interface is provided in tBits 
			Collabwrite to change the following fields of the selected 
			Documents; only those authorized to change these fields can make use 
			of this option. Click <strong>More</strong> to make changes to these 
			fields:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                Category</li>
                <li>
                Status</li>
                <li>
                Severity</li>
                <li>
                    Document Type</li>
            </ul>
            <p>You can also change the private status of the selected Documents, 
			and add text in the description. The description is added to each of 
			the selected Documents.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Note:</strong> Bulk Document updates do not follow the <a href="#BusinessRules">
                    business rules</a> for the Domain . They do follow the 
			permissions for that area, however. So, for instance, if you are 
			authorized to close Documents but the business rule &quot;Do not allow 
			pending Documents to be closed&quot; is in effect, a bulk Document update 
			to close all selected Documents will succeed, even if some are 
			pending.</p>
            <h3><a name="Permissions"></a>Permissions
            </h3>
            <p>The default configuration of a Domain allocates access to the 
			fields of a Document as detailed here. Access rights include those 
			of a general user for all other roles; for example, a Logger has all 
			the access rights that a general user has as well as those for a 
			person submitting the Document. Access for the roles of User, 
			Logger, and Subscriber is defined by your association with the 
			Document. Access for the roles of Assignee, Analyst and Manager is 
			explicitly granted for the entire Domain .
</p>
            <p>A mailing list can be used to allot access rights to a Domain . 
			In that case, any member of that mailing list is allotted the 
			permissions given to the mailing list. The absolute access rights of 
			the user are a union of all the access roles allotted, directly to 
			that email ID and to mailing lists which include the email ID. In 
			case that a mailing list includes another mailing list, the mailing 
			lists are exhaustively expanded to give those access rights to all 
			members of the mailing list. </p>
            <p>A tBits Collabwrite Domain can be configured to be totally 
			private; only users with View access to that Domain can read 
			Documents submitted.</p>
            <p>Note that an Analyst is someone who is designated as a role 
			analyst for the Domain . An Assignee in this table refers to an 
			Assignee for this Document.You can view your Assignee relationships 
			by clicking <strong>View My Domain Profile</strong> on the <a href="#SettingsDialog">
			Settings</a> page.</p>

            <p>IUCs allow Domain analysts to update Document fields (e.g. 
			Status, Assignee, Due Date, etc.) inline within the description of a 
			Document update and within email replies, using a special syntax.</p>
            <p>IUCs provide a notation to allow the specification of settings 
			for most Document fields from within the body of an update, whether 
			submitted through the web or through email. This notation must 
			appear at the start or the end of the message, or can be used in 
			both places. At the start of the message, once any text which is not 
			of this syntax appears in the message, any further text is treated 
			as the Document description. Similarly, starting from the end of the 
			message, only lines at the end which are purely IUC lines are 
			considered update commands; any non-IUC lines demarcate the 
			description portion of the update from the ending IUCs. </p>
            <p>This feature can be enabled for users of the Domain by the <a href="#AdministratorsRoles">
                      tBits Collabwrite development team</a>, and the exact 
			syntax of each IUC descriptor is <a href="#CustomizingDomain">
                      configurable</a>
			for the Domain . See the IUC Descriptor Table link for the Domain 
			for a list of supported field descriptors and the supported list 
			type field values, or the <a href="#Descriptors">descriptor</a> 
			table above for a list of common descriptors. The meaning of the 
			descriptors can be inferred from the long versions. </p>
            <p>Acceptable values vary with the kind of field which is to be 
			updated. For fields which take a single value, the value must have 
			the notation:</p>
            <blockquote><code> /descriptor:value</code></blockquote>
            <p>For a field which can accept more than one value, the value can 
			be <em>absolute</em> or <em>relative</em>, as defined in the 
			following table:</p>
            <table border="1">
			  <tbody><tr><th>Notation</th><th>Description</th></tr>
              <tr><td> <code>/descriptor:value_or_list  </code></td>

This notation can be used for fields which take a single value also. </td>
              </tr>
            </tbody></table>
			<p>For absolute notation, specify a slash and one of the 
			descriptors, followed by a colon (:), an equal sign (=) and/or white 
			space and then a value. If there are multiple values, separate them 
			with a comma, a semicolon, or white space. For example:</p>
                <blockquote>
                  <p><code>/category:purchasing<br>
            		/status closed<br>
					/subscribers: milton,smythe<br>
					/Assignee = jones bart </code></p>
                </blockquote>

                <p>The descriptors for fields and for list type values are 
				case-insensitive; you can write /due or /Due or /DUE with the 
				same effect. No quoting is required; the value is considered to 
				be the text from the descriptor to the end of the line in the 
				case of a text field. For example, you can use either of the 
				following IUCs:</p>
                <blockquote>
                  <p><code>/subject: [3.5] Descriptor updates for this section. <br>
    				/subscribers: tBits Collabwrite-dev@hyd </code></p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>Minimal IUC matching is supported: if the beginning of a 
				descriptor is unambiguous, then a prefix of the descriptor name 
				can be used. The prefix must have a minimum of three characters. 
				So, for example, &quot;<code>sta</code>&quot; or &quot;<code>stat</code>&quot; or &quot;<code>statu</code>&quot; 
				are unique prefixes for the field &quot;<code>status</code>&quot; in the 
				standard Domain configuration. Note that &quot;<code>sub</code>&quot; is 
				defined as a descriptor for &quot;<code>subscribers</code>&quot; in the 
				standard tBits Collabwrite configuration, so, although normally 
				&quot;<code>sub</code>&quot; would be ambiguous as it matches both &quot;<code>subscribers</code>&quot; 
				and &quot;<code>subject</code>&quot;, in fact, &quot;<code>/sub</code>&quot; can be 
				used to mean &quot;<code>/subscribers</code>&quot;. Minimal matching 
				applies to the descriptors for list type field values as well, 
				so <code>&quot;/sta:clos</code>&quot; matches &quot;<code>sta</code>&quot; to &quot;<code>status</code>&quot; 
				and &quot;<code>clos</code>&quot; to &quot;<code>closed</code>&quot;. See the table <a href="#IUCMinimalMatchExamples">
				below</a>
				for examples. Note that a descriptor can be defined with fewer 
				than 3 characters, and in that case, the full descriptor name 
				matches, even though the length is less than three. </p>
                <p>If the descriptor for a list type field value is unambiguous, 
				then that can also be used as an IUC. So, for example, </p>
                <blockquote>
                  <p> <code>/closed</code></p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>is equivalent to</p>
          <blockquote>
            <p><code>/status closed</code></p>
          </blockquote>
                <p>This can be used in combination with the minimal matching 
				facility. So, for example, if the category includes the values &quot;<code>unix_server</code>&quot; 
				and &quot;<code>unix_client</code>&quot;, then an IUC of &quot;<code>/unix</code>&quot; 
				is ambiguous, but &quot;<code>/unix_c</code>&quot; uniquely is identified 
				as &quot;<code>/cat:unix_client</code>&quot;. </p>
                <p>The value of a field can be <a href="#ClearIUCField">cleared</a> 
				using an equal sign and no argument, or by providing an empty 
				string as the descriptor argument.</p>

                <li> If you use &quot;=&quot; on a line, you cannot use &quot;+&quot; or &quot;-&quot;.</li>
                <li>
                You cannot use the &quot;-&quot; on a CC line, or for a value which is not 
				already in that field.</li>
                <li>If you specify Document field of a list type like severity, 
				you can specify exactly one value, and the spelling of the value 
				must match exactly.</li>
                <li>
                If you specify the /subject descriptor, the text you specify 
				after the descriptor is used as the new subject of the Document.</li>
                <li>
                Use the /mail descriptor to specify whether to notify by email 
				(Yes) or not (No).</li>
                <li>
                It is a good practice to insert a blank line between all the IUC

                <li>
                    You cannot make a private Document public with an IUC

                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>Note that Document field changes made via IUCs are checked by 
			tBits Collabwrite for <a href="#SimultaneousUpdates">
                    conflicting simultaneous updates</a>, but there is no table 
			provided with information about the conflicts, so caution should be 
			exercised in the use of IUCs. In particular, ascertain that the 
			current value of Document fields that you intend to change when 
			submitting an update with IUCs.
</p>
            <p>Errors in the use of IUCs in email result in an email

            <h4><a name="IUCPrecedence"></a>IUC Precedence</h4>
            <p>IUCs can appear at the start and the end of the description 
			portion of an update. Within the web interface, the same fields can 
			also be set using the web selections. Should the same field be set 
			in more than one place, the precedence, from low to high, is as 
			follows:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Set with web interface</li>
            <li>Start of update</li>
            <li>End of update</li>
            </ul>
            <p>If the IUC descriptor can take only a single value or if absolute 
			notation is used, the last value given is used. For example, there 
			can be only one Severity for a Document. If the IUC descriptor can 
			take multiple values, and if additive notation is used, the 
			precedence goes through all the specified values from the start to 
			end of the precedence list, and the final result is the value.</p>
            <p>Note the following:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
If a descriptor can take more than one value, such as a subscriber list, all the 
values can appear on the same line. Multiple values can be separated by commas, 
semicolons, or white space.<br>
    For example, <br>
    <span style="margin-left: 1cm;"><code>/log: vinodg ritesh</code></span> <br>
    Alternatively, you can use additive notation. </li>
              <li> If a descriptor appears more than once and absolute notation 
				is used, only the last occurrence of the descriptor is used. <br>
    			For example, in this sequence, only the later log descriptor is 
				used:<br>
    <span style="margin-left: 1cm;"><code>/log: vinodg </code></span> <code><br>
    <span style="margin-left: 1cm;">/assign: +ritesh </span> <br>
    <span style="margin-left: 1cm;">/log: ritesh </span></code></li>
            </ul>
            <p>For example, suppose that the following values are specified in a 
			single update:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>In the web interface:<br>
              <blockquote><code>severity: high<br>
              	status: open
              <br>
              	category: bug
              <br>
              	AssignedTo: jessica<br> 
			  	subscriber: norman</code></blockquote>
			  </li>
            <li> At the start of the update description:<br>
              <blockquote><code>/sev:low<br>
              	/AssignedTo:+jason</code></blockquote>
            </li>
            <li>At the end of the update description:<br>
              <blockquote><code>/stat: pending_qa<br>
              	/sub=ashley<br>
              	/ass:+sita,-jason<br>
              	/stat:reviewed</code></blockquote>
            </li>
            </ul>
            <p>Then the final settings would be</p>
            <ul>
              <li><code>severity: high</code></li>
            <li><code>status: reviewed </code></li>
            <li><code>category: bug</code></li>
            <li><code>   AssignedTo: jessica, sita</code></li>

            <p>TQL is a specialized language for submitting queries to tBits 
			Collabwrite. It provides you with a flexible way of defining and 
			storing queries.
            </p>
            <p>For example, you can:</p>
            <ul style="list-style-type: none;">
                <li>
                Search for Documents where both vaibhav and ritesh are 
				Assignee&#39;s.</li>
                <li>
                Search for Documents due in the next week.</li>
                <li>
                    Search for Documents you updated in the last month.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                The <a href="#AdvancedSearch">Advanced Search Query Builder</a> 
				generates TQL. You can type TQL directly in the text box, or use 
				the query builder to enter it for you. 
            </p>
            <p>For example, you can specify
            </p>
            <pre style="margin-left: 1cm;">category:Pending -stat:closed</pre>
            <p>to search for queries with a category of Pending and a status of 
			not closed.
            </p>
            <p>If you use the query builder, the fields available to you depend 
			on the field type and on the value you select. The date field 
			selectors are particularly expressive. For instance, if you select a 
			field with a date type such as a due date:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    You might select a value like <strong>Today</strong>, in 
					which case you are done;</li>
                <li>
                    You might select a date range like <strong>Between</strong>, 
					in which case you are prompted a &quot;from&quot; and a &quot;to&quot; date, 
					using a calendar browser;</li>
                <li>
                    You might select <strong>Last &#39;n&#39; days</strong> or <strong>
					Next &#39;n&#39; weeks</strong>, in which case you are prompted for 
					the value of <strong>&#39;n&#39;</strong>. You might want to say <strong>
					Last 4 days</strong> so then you would enter <strong>4</strong>
                    in the text box that appears after the <strong>Next &#39;n&#39; days</strong> 
					selection.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4><a name="WritingTQL"></a>Writing TQL Queries</h4>
            <p>A simple TQL query consists of a <a href="#Descriptors">
			descriptor</a>, a colon, and an argument or argument list. The colon 
			is mandatory. A descriptor can be considered an abbreviation for a 
			Document field name or list type value name in a Domain . There are 
			some standard descriptors, but they can be set on a Domain basis. An 
			argument list has a comma as a separator. </p>
            <p>For example,</p>
			<table border="1">
				<tbody><tr><th>Field name</th><th>Descriptor</th></tr>
				<tr><td>Category</td><td><code>cat</code></td>
				</tr>
				<tr><td>Logger</td><td><code>log</code></td>
				</tr>
				<tr><td>Due Date</td><td><code>due</code></td>
				</tr>
			</tbody></table>

            <p>The notation accepted for TQL queries is as outlined here:</p>
            <p>For single-valued fields:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><code>field:value </code></li>
              <li><code> field:comma-separated list of values</code></li>
            </ul>
          <p>For multi-valued fields:      </p>
            <ul>
              <li><code>descriptor:value</code></li>
              <li><code> descriptor:value1,value2 </code></li>
              <li><code>descriptor:value1 AND value2 </code></li>
              <li><code> descriptor:value1 OR value2</code></li>
              <li><code>descriptor:value1 NOT value2</code></li>
              <li> <code>has:descriptor</code>  (to check that the value of the 
				field is not empty)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The patterns in which arguments can be specified with the 
			descriptors depend on the type of the descriptor and are listed in 
			the <a href="#Patterns">Argument Patterns</a> section. Complex 
			queries can be formed by joining simple queries using the logical 
			operators AND, OR and NOT. A minus (-) before a TQL query is 
			synonymous with NOT. <a href="#Grouping">Parentheses</a> can be used 
			to create yet more complex queries.</p>
            <p>Parameters which include a colon (:), a hyphen (-), square 
			bracket ([]), or a space ( ) must be enclosed within quotes. The one 
			exception is that dates can be specified with a hyphen.</p>
            <p>For example:</p>
            <ul>
              <li> <code>category:pending </code><br>
                  <span style="margin-left: 5mm;">Search for Documents in the 
				&quot;pending&quot; category.</span><br>
              </li>
              <li><code> category:server AND Assignee:vaibhav </code><br>
                  <span style="margin-left: 5mm;">Search for Documents in the 
				&quot;server&quot; category that are Assignee &quot;vaibhav&quot;.<br>
              </span></li>
              <li><code> AssignedTo:vaibhav NOT status:closed </code><br>
                  <span style="margin-left: 5mm;">Search for Documents Assignee 
				&quot;vaibhav&quot; </span>which are not closed.<br>
              </li>
              <li><code> category:(pending,development) Assignee:vaibhav </code><br>
                  <span style="margin-left: 5mm;">Search for Documents in the

            <p>Although the general user need never know this, there are several 
			ways in which the Document system can be customized for a Domain . A 
			Domain might define a number of <em>custom fields</em> (as in the 
			Proprietary Domain ). Most Domains define a number of categories and 
			Document types appropriate to the problem domain. Category Analysts 
			are Assignee each category, and for each category it is specified 
			whether that person gets email, and whether he or she is a <a href="#AutomaticAssignment">
			volunteer</a>. These settings can be viewed by clicking <strong>View 
			My Domain Profile</strong> on the <a href="#SettingsDialog">
                    Settings</a> page.            </p>

            <p>Access to the fields within a Document and the permission to add 
			or change them are set based on the <strong>role</strong> of the 
			user. More than one role can apply; for instance, one could be both 
			a Logger and an Assignee. In that case, the applicable permissions 
			are a union of those allowed for all applicable roles. The supported 
			roles are given in increasing order of access to the fields of a 
			Document.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>User</strong>: <strong></strong>
                	A general user can add or modify few of the fields within a 
					Document.</li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Subscriber</strong>: A subscriber for a Document. 
					This is a contextual role.</li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Logger</strong>: The Logger of a Document. This is a 
					contextual role.</li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Assignee</strong>: The Assignee for a Document. This 
					is a contextual role. Only a <em>category Assignee </em>
                	can be assigned Documents within the specified category.</li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Analyst</strong>: <strong></strong>
                	An analyst in a Domain is authorized to act on Documents in 
					that Domain .</li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Admin</strong>: <strong></strong>
                	This refers to the administrator role defined above.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Some roles are <em>contextual</em>: they are assigned based on 
			the relationship of the user to a particular Document.</p>
            <p>A user can be defined to be an <em>analyst</em> for a Domain . As 
			an orthogonal concept to that, a <em>category Assignee </em>is a 
			possible <em>Assignee</em>
                for various categories of the Domain . There is no access 
			permission associated with a category Assignee, but there is with an 
			Assignee or an analyst. The main difference within tBits Collabwrite 
			is that an Assignee is a contextual role, and so an Assignee has 
			access to those Documents already Assignee him or her; the analyst 
			has access to all Documents in the Domain based on the role of 
			analyst. However, only a category Assignee can be assigned a 
			Document.</p>
            <h4><a name="WhatIsConfigurable"></a>What is Configurable by an 
			Administrator
            </h4>
            <p>Note that only a few options can be set by the Domain 
			Administrator; most must be set by the  <a href="#ConfigurableBytBitsTeam">
			tBits Collabwrite development team</a>. The Domain Administrator can 
			only manage the categories, category Assignees, and analysts, and 
			assign various roles to users of the Domain . These can be set from 
			the <strong>Users</strong> and <strong>Manage</strong>
                views of the <strong>Admin</strong> interface. There is a link 
			to the Admin interface from the tBits Collabwrite Main page, as well 
			as from the Document details page. </p>
            <p>To add a user for a Domain , go to the <strong>Users</strong> 
			view and click on the <strong>Add User</strong> link.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Set the category Assignee and email notification status for 
					this user by one of these methods.
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            On the <strong>Categories</strong>
                        	view, select the email ID, then select an email 
							notification policy, whether the user is a category 
							Assignee, and the volunteer status for each 
							category.</li>
                        <li>
                            Select the <strong>Manage -&gt; Categories</strong> 
							view. Click on each category in turn, and select the <a href="#NotificationRules">
							email notification</a>, category Assignee, and 
							volunteer status desired for each category for the 
							user.
                        </li>
                    </ul></li>
                <li>
                    On the <strong>Roles </strong>
					view, select the roles which are to be allocated to the

					as an Analyst for the Domain . </li>
                <li>
                    You can use the <strong>Manage</strong> view to set email 
					notification policies for the Status, Severity, and Document 
					Type values within the Domain .
</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Note that you must click <strong>Save Settings</strong>

			you switch to a different user or a different view, any change you 
			have made is lost. </p>
            <h4><a name="ConfigurableBytBitsTeam"></a>What is Configurable by 
			the tBits Collabwrite Development Team
            </h4>
            <p>Submit Documents to the <a href="http://tbits.tbitsglobal.com/add-request/tBits" target="_blank">
			tBits Collabwrite development team</a>  to make changes as described 
			in this section. See also the section on <a href="#NewDomain">
			creating a new Domain </a>. </p>
            <p>The <strong>Admin</strong> page includes tabs for <strong>
			Properties</strong>, <strong>
                    Fields</strong>, <strong>Roles</strong>, <strong>Users</strong>, 
			and <strong>Manage</strong>. Only the <strong>Users</strong> and <strong>
			Manage</strong> tabs can be changed by a business administrator; the 
			others can be changed only by the tBits Collabwrite development 
			team. The <strong>Properties</strong> tab is used to define most of 
			the characteristics of a Domain . The <strong>Fields</strong> tab is 
			used to define all the fields of a Domain . The <strong>Roles</strong> 
			tab is used to specify what sorts of access different kinds of users 
			have to the Domain ; for example, general users, loggers, and 
			analysts. </p>
            <p>The mapping of mail severity levels to tBits Collabwrite status 
			values can also be customized for each Domain . For instance, an 
			importance level of <strong>High</strong>
                in mail can map to a tBits Collabwrite severity of <strong>
			Critical</strong> or <strong>High</strong>.</p>
            <p>Any aspect of the set up of a Domain can be set through 
			configurable permissions. For example, a Domain can track fields 
			internally in a Domain , but not display them to general users, such 
			as the time to complete a task. An entire Domain can be set to be 
			private, so that access to the Domain is restricted to authorized 
			users. Only the Logger, Assignee, and Subscriber fields are not 
			configurable.
            </p>
            <p>Custom fields can be added and new values for list type fields 
			(such as Category and Severity) can be specified for a Domain . </p>
            <p>The option to update fields of a Document via email using <a href="#InlineUpdateCommands">
                    IUCs</a> can be configured for analysts for a Domain . The 
			exact descriptor syntax accepted can also be configured.
            </p>
            <p>If the field is a list type field, then the list types and their 
			relative display order can be specified. For each value, the type 
			can be specified to be any of:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Final</strong>: A type marked as <strong>Final</strong>
                	is a type which, once set, cannot be changed. Anyone can set 
					a Document to have this type, but no one can change the 
					field value after that. New Documents cannot be set to a 
					final type. This type is shown in light grey in the search 
					results and Document details pages.</li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Private</strong>: A type marked as <strong>Private</strong>
                	can be viewed only by authorized users.</li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Active</strong>: A type is <strong>Active</strong> 
					if it can be selected. If a type is to be retired from use, 
					it cannot be deleted if any Documents have been marked with 
					that type. However, it can be made <strong>Inactive</strong>. 
					In that case, new Documents and updates to Documents cannot 
					be marked with that type.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>The <strong>Fields</strong> tab also shows values for the <strong>
			Field Tracking Display</strong> value. This refers to whether 
			changes in that field value are detailed within updates to a 
			Document. For example, the subscriber list is not shown in the 
			header, but it is tracked in the Document in a light font:</p>
            <blockquote>
            <p>[ Subscribers: ritesh, sandeep, vineet] 
            </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>The <strong>Regex</strong> field can be used for a custom field 
			to restrict field values to those that matched the specified Perl 
			regular expression.</p>
            <p>The <strong>Description</strong> for the field or the type is 
			only used internally; it is not displayed to general users in the 
			tBits Collabwrite interface.
            </p>
            <h4><a name="BusinessRules"></a>Business Rules
            </h4>
            <p>The Domain can be configured to follow business rules. Examples 
			of business rules are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                Pending Documents cannot be closed.</li>
                <li>
                    Unassigned Documents cannot be closed.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>In the case of a bulk Document update, sometimes these business 
			rules are ignored.
            </p>
            <p>Business rules have been generalized with these definitions:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                Business Rule =&gt; [Condition]+ [Action]+</li>
                <li>
                    Action =&gt; [Validate Current State] | [Validate Transition] | 
					[Modify to a different state]
                </li>
            </ol>
            <p>However, business rules and their effects are not visible to 
			general users, and so it is not encouraged to use them extensively 
			in the Domains .
            </p>
            <p>If you believe you need a new business rule for a Domain you 
			manage, please contact the <a href="#ConfigurableBytBitsTeam">tBits 
			Collabwrite development team</a>. </p>
            <h4><a name="DueDate"></a>Setting the Default and Allowed Due Dates</h4>
            <p>Overdue items are shown with indicators in the Document interface 
			and in the Documents. Additionally, the due dates of a Domain can be 
			configured to be mandatory, optional (with or without a default due 
			date), or disabled.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>available/mandatory/set-by-default </strong>
                    <br>
					The due date is pre-populated with the default value 
					specified in the Domain configuration. Users cannot clear 
					the value in this field, so every Document is associated 
					with a due date. <br></li>
                <li>
                    <strong>available/optional /set-by-default </strong>
                    <br>
					The due date is pre-populated with the default value 
					specified in the Domain configuration. Users are given the 
					choice to clear the value in the field. If the due date is 
					cleared, the Document is not associated with any due date. 
					Users can set or clear the value at any point during the 
					lifetime of Documents in this Domain . <br></li>
                <li>
                    <strong>available/optional /not-set-by-default</strong>
                    <br>
                    The due date is empty by default. Users can choose to 
					specify a due date to associate with a Document. The due 
					date can be set or cleared at any point during the lifetime 
					of Documents in this Domain .
                    <br></li>
                <li>
                    <strong>unavailable</strong>
                    <br>
                    The due date field is not shown when submitting or updating 
					a Document.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Only the tBits Collabwrite development team has change 
				permission for the due date field.
            </p>
            <p>
                If the Domain &#39;s due date configuration option is changed to 
				mandatory (the first option above) and if the due date is null, 
				then the first time a person authorized to change the due date 
				subsequently appends to the Document, he or she <em>must</em> 
				enter a due date. The Domain can be configured to use just a 
				date, without a time, or to use a date and time.
            </p>
            <p>If the due date configuration is one of the optional 
			configurations, then in the Add Document page and the Update 
			Document page there is a <strong>Clear/Set Default</strong>
                label next to the Due Date.
            </p>
            <h4><a name="NotificationRules"></a>Enhanced Email Notification 
			Settings</h4>
            <p>The administrator for a Domain can configure the email 
			notification settings for each list type field separately. There can 
			be an email notification setting for each Category, Severity, 
			Document Type, and Status in the Domain . For example, you can set 
			it up so that someone gets mail for all Documents with Critical 
			Severity. </p>
            <p>Additionally, there is the ability to define calendars (e.g. 
			&quot;Outside Singapore Helpdesk hours&quot;) to allow different notification 
			rules during the day versus off-hours. Explanations of the calendar 
			options and a list of holidays are available by clicking on the <strong>
			calendar definitions</strong> link on the Admin page. Contact the <a href="#ConfigurableBytBitsTeam">
			tBits Collabwrite development team</a> to define a custom calendar.
            </p>
            <h4><a name="MailingListsForConfiguring"></a>Configuring Analysts 
			Using Mailing Lists</h4>
            <p>A Domain can be configured using a mailing list to specify the 
			analysts and the category Assignee for the Domain rather than 
			listing each individual. As a result, when employees join and leave 
			a project, updating the mailing list is sufficient to update the 
			Domain. However, differences in configuration for individual 
			analysts cannot be made if the Domain is configured using a mailing 
			list to specify the analysts.

/*
The transpose of a directed graph G = (V, E) is the graph G T  = (V, E T ), where E T  = {(v, u)  
V Ã— V : (u, v)  E}. Thus, G T  is G with all its edges reversed. Describe efficient algorithms for 
computing G T  from G, for both the adjacency-list and adjacency-matrix representations of G. 
Analyze the running times of your algorithms.

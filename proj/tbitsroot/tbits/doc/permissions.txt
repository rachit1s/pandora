Role 'User' doesnt mean BA user. It means any user inside the system.
Permission on 'BA- view' means a role can view BA.
If you add a user to BA and don't assign any role. It is as good as not adding him to BA.

Private BA, If a BA is private a User will not be able to see it. It is effectively equivalent of not giving User View permission on 'BA'.


Manager can:
See 'BA Users', 'Manage Fields', SMS Logs


In database: Add: 1, Change: 2, View: 4. Can remember it ACV (Lexical sorting).

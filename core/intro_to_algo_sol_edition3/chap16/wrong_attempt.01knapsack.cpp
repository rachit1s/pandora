/*
The 0-1 knapsack problem is the following. A thief robbing a store Ô¨Ånds n
items. The ith item is worth vi dollars and weighs w i pounds, where vi and w i are
integers. The thief wants to take as valuable a load as possible, but he can carry at
most W pounds in his knapsack, for some integer W . Which items should he take?
(We call this the 0-1 knapsack problem because for each item, the thief must either
take it or leave it behind; he cannot take a fractional amount of an item or take an
item more than once.)

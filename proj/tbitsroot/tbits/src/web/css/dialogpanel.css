    of the body element between "hidden" and "auto" in order to 
    prevent the scrollbars from remaining visible after the the 
    Resizable Panel is hidden.  For more information on this issue, 
    read the comments in the "container-core.css" file.
   
    We use the #reziablepanel_c id based specifier, so that the rule
    is specific enough to over-ride the .bd overflow rule above.

    PLEASE NOTE: It is necessary to set the "overflow" property of
    the underlay element to "visible" in order for the 
    scrollbars on the body of a Resizable Panel instance to be 
    visible.  By default the "overflow" property of the underlay 
    element is set to "auto" when a Panel is made visible on
    Gecko for Mac OS X to prevent scrollbars from poking through
    it on that browser + platform combintation.  For more

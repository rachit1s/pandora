            <h3>New Features in TBits V6.0</h3>
            <p>There are many new features, but here are some of the highlights:</p>
            <h2>Searching</h2>
            <ul style="list-style-type:none ">
                <li>
                    <b><a href="/web/tbits-help.htm#SearchShortcuts">Search Shortcuts</a>:</b>Search 
                    Shortcuts in Version 6.0 provide a few improvements over the former saved 
                    searches. For example, you can save a search shortcut as a <em>public</em> shortcut, 
                    so it can be used by other users of the business area as well.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b><a href="/web/tbits-help.htm#SearchAllBAs">Searching All Business Areas</a>:</b> 
                    There is a new tab for searching all business areas in the current TBits 
                    database at once. The interface is similar to the other search panels.</li>
                <li>
                    <b><a href="/web/tbits-help.htm#QueryLanguage">DQL</a>:</b> There is a new TBits 
                    Query Language, DQL, which lets you build flexible queries. The Advanced Search 
                    tab includes a query builder.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Managing Requests
            </h2>
            <ul style="list-style-type:none ">
                <li>
                    <b><a href="/web/tbits-help.htm#TrackingUnreadRequests">Tracking Read/Unread Status of 
                            Requests</a>:</b> The TBits web interface now keeps track of which 
                    requests have updates and requests that you have not yet read. On the Search 
                    Results page, bold text is the indicator, with a double-arrow icon denoting a 
                    new request. On the Request Details page, unread updates are outlined in a 
                    different color.</li>
                <li>
                    <b><a href="/web/tbits-help.htm#DueDate">Due Date Improvements</a>:</b> Prior to 
                    this version, most groups have ignored the due date field because there was no 
                    notification mechanism for overdue requests and because every request had to 
                    have a due date. In Version 6.0, overdue items are shown with indicators on the 
                    Search Results page and on the Request Details page. Additionally, the due 
                    dates of a business area can be configured to be mandatory, optional (with or 
                    without a default due date), or disabled.</li>
                <li>
                    <b><a href="/web/tbits-help.htm#Autocomplete">Autocomplete Improvements</a>:</b> There 
                    are improvements in autocomplete for the fields which take email ids, namely, <strong>
                        Assignee</strong>, <strong>CC</strong>, <strong>Logger</strong>, and <strong>Subscriber</strong>. 
                    Autocomplete matching is now based on the first name, the last name, or the 
                    email address.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b><a href="/web/tbits-help.htm#PrimaryAssignee">Primary Assignee</a>:</b> As 
                    before, requests can have multiple assignees. It is now possible to designate 
                    one of multiple assignees as <em>primary</em> by putting a * before the user 
                    ID. This can help groups assign ultimate responsibility to a single person.</li>
                <li>
                    <b><a href="/web/tbits-help.htm#TransferringRequests">Transferring Requests</a>:</b>
                    It is common for TBits requests to be logged in the wrong business area. Now 
                    the Request Details page includes a simple option <strong>Transfer Request</strong>.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b><a href="/web/tbits-help.htm#LinkedRequests">Linked Requests</a>:</b> TBits 
                    now supports reciprocal links between similar requests, whether or not they are 
                    in the same business area. In previous versions, there was only the concept of 
                    a parent/subrequest relationship between two requests in the same business 
                    area. Now a request can be linked to another request in any business area. The 
                    relationship is transitive: that is, if request A is related to request B, and 
                    request B is related to request C, then request A is also related to request C.</li>
                <li>
                    <b><a href="/web/tbits-help.htm#Drafts">Drafts</a>:</b> You can save drafts of 
                    request updates in progress and reload them at a later time. You can also 
                    configure TBits to autosave drafts of your updates at fixed time intervals 
                    using the <strong>Options</strong> page.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b><a href="/web/tbits-help.htm#SimultaneousUpdates">Conflict Resolution For Simultaneous 
                            Request Updates</a>:</b> Until now, if two people tried to update a 
                    request on the web at the same time (e.g. to change the category or subject), 
                    the second person would end up overwriting the first person's changes. Now the 
                    second person gets a warning about the conflicts and is offered a resolution 
                    method to avoid losing the first person's changes.</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Email</h2>
            <ul style="list-style-type:none ">
                <li>
                    <b><a href="/web/tbits-help.htm#EmailAttachments">Improved Handling of Attached Email 
                            Messages</a>:</b> In previous versions, email attachments were 
                    converted to plain text format and consequently the formatting was lost. In 
                    Version 6.0, an email message can be attached to a request retaining the 
                    original formatting.</li>
                <li>
                    <b><a href="/web/tbits-help.htm#EmailUpdateCommands">Email Update Commands or EUCs</a>:</b>
                    EUCs allow business area analysts to update request fields (e.g. Status, 
                    Assignee, Due Date, etc.) through email replies by using a special syntax.</li>
                <li>
                    <b><a href="/web/tbits-help.htm#EmailWrapping">Email Appends No Longer Wrap Text</a>:</b>
                    In previous versions, text submitted in email replies was wrapped at about 76 
                    columns. Now it is no longer wrapped, so an email reply to a request has the 
                    same look as a web-submitted update to a request.</li>
                <li>
                    <b><a href="/web/tbits-help.htm#NotificationRules">Enhanced Email Notification Options</a>:</b>
                    The administrator for a business area can now configure the email notification 
                    settings for each list type field separately. There can be an email 
                    notification setting for each Category, Severity, Request Type, and Status in 
                    the business area. For example, you can set it up so that someone gets mail for 
                    all requests with Critical Severity. Additionally, there is the ability to 
                    define calendars (e.g. &quot;New York business hours&quot;) to allow different 
                    notification rules during the day versus off-hours.</li>

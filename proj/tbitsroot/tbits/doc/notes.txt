1. The options page stopped working after change password.
2. Admin Properties wasnt saving the date time format.
3. The user's date time format had no effect on the the display of time. Now, the date time format is completely based on user's settings. 
In case, user's profile doesnt have date time format, it sets the 6th one as default.
4. If we change the captions of  types of Severity, it would not display the images correctly. To it I have added the property file. It could have been done in some other way, I believe.
5. The scheduler wasnt starting automaticall due to mistake in web.xml

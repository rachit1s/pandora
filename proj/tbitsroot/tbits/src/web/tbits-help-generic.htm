            </h3>
            <p>tBits is a workflow management and request tracking system. It was built to 
                improve the management of work within groups or Domains , as well as to 
                manage interdependencies between groups. tBits has a web-based interface and 
                an email-based interface.
            </p>
            <p>The tBits web interface was designed to make it easy to understand requests 
                and to configure the pages you use in tBits. The various options available to 
                you in tBits are all available from the tBits Main page; as a result, you 
                also have easy access to the data associated with any requests you are acting 
                on.
            </p>
            <p>The various search options, namely Search, Advanced Search, and My Requests, are 
                all available as tabs from the tBits Main page. There is a tab for 
                searching all Domains as well.
            </p>
            <p>This document describes how to use tBits. Sections in this document:</p>

            <p>This is not an exhaustive list, but does include most of the commonly used 
                fields. Some fields can be set by any user, some can be set only by analysts in 
                that Domain , and some are set by tBits. Fields that  cannot be set 
                by users are greyed out in the user interface. Refer to the <a href="#Permissions">Permissions</a>
                section for more details of access to request fields.
</p>
            <p>A <EM>list type</EM> field has predefined values which you can select. For example, the Severity values are typically Critical, High, Medium, and Low. </p>
            <p>Request fields can be configured to the needs of a particular Domain , 
                both with respect to the exact values permitted for a field,
              as well as which  fields are defined. For instance, the Category
              field has different defined 
                values depending on the domain. Some domains have extra fields
               (or <em>custom fields</em>). For example, the Proprietary Domain has 
            fields to track the estimated and actual time to complete the task.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    The <em>Category</em> and <em>Request
                    Type</em>
                are used by the analysts in a domain to manage the kinds of requests
                 which they receive and need to act on. In general, the category
                is used to 
                express the part of the application which should be addressed
                if the domain is for a product, and the groups with which the
                domain works if the  domain provides a service, and the request
                type is used to express the 
                sort of action that needs to be taken. For example, the categories
                for a  product could include Database, Scripts, Server and Web
                UI. The request types 
                could include Bug, Development, Issue, and QA.</li>
                <li>
                    The <em>Status</em>
                is used to track the progress of a request, for instance, from Pending to Open 
                to Active to Awaiting Response or Pending QA to Closed. The exact statuses in 
                use vary between Domains .</li>
                <li>
                    The <em>Severity</em>
                can be set by the Submitted By of a request to indicate the urgency of the problem 
                presented in the request.</li>
                <li>
                    The <em>Submitted By</em>, <em>Assigned To</em>, and <em>Subscribers</em> are all fields 
                    which take user  IDs. The difference between adding a user to the 
                    Subscriber list and to the CC list is that the Subscriber is a perpetual 
                    assignment, and the CC a one-time assignment: that is, someone added in the CC 
                    field for an update to a request will receive email for that update only, and 
                    not on subsequent updates. The subscribers receive all email associated with 
                    that request.

</p>
            <h4 id="ColorIntBits">Color in tBits</h4>
            <p>tBits uses color to notify you of the status of requests and updates. Request updates can be outlined in one of three colors:</p>

            <ul>
              <li>The outline color of new updates is ochre: <span style="color:#b38f00 ">new update color</span></li>
			  <li>The outline color of updates which you have read is grey: <span style="color:#D9D9D9">read update color</span> </li>
              <li>The outline color of the first update is the Domain theme color. The default theme color is blue: <span style="color:#6679b3 ">default Domain theme color</span> </li>
            </ul>
            <p>The Domain theme color is also used for headers in the web interface; for example, the <a href="http://tBits.tbitsglobal.com/search/Sys" target="_blank">Systems</a> Domain has defined an unusual theme color. </p>
            <p>If a 
                      request has a severity of Critical, the request number is displayed in bold 
              font and red color.</p>
            <p>The outline colors actually used depend on whether you are using the email or the web interface, and on whether you have set the Domain to track read and unread requests for you.</p>
            <ul>
              <li>In email:
                <ul>
                  <li>The most recent update is always outlined in the new update color.</li>
                  <li>The first update is outlined in the Domain theme color.</li>
                  <li>Other updates between the first and the most recent are outlined in grey.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>In the web interface:
                <ul>
                  <li>All unread updates are outlined in the new update color.</li>
                  <li>The first update, if read, is outlined in the Domain theme color. </li>
                  <li>Other read updates are outlined in grey.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>There are also colors used to convey the severity of a request when <a href="#Export">exporting to Excel</a>. </p>
            <h4 id="Legend">Legend: Icons and Abbreviations</h4>
            <p>The tBits Legend in the <a href="#SearchResults">Search Results page</a> gives an overview of the meaning of the icons and the most commonly used abbreviations in tBits.</p>

            </h2>
            <p><a name="Instances"></a>The request system web interface can be accessed from 
            intranet/intranet pages. </p>
            <p>The 
                  default page is the <a href="#MyRequests">My Requests</a> page. The main page 
                  includes several option tabs for <a href="#SearchResults">searching for requests</a> in tBits, and there is a separate form for <a href="#Logging">submitting a new 
            request</a>. </p>
            <p>The <strong>My Requests</strong> page shows requests with which you are 
                associated across all Domains in that tBits database. The <strong>
                    Search</strong> interface
                    allows you to find requests based on the subject,  text,
                    or any of the fields associated with a particular request.
                    The <strong>Add 
                    Request</strong> page allows you to select a Domain and set various 
                fields when entering a new request in a Domain . The web interface
                    also  gives you control over whether email notification should
                    be sent in response to 
                this update, and if so, to whom it should be sent.
            </p>
            <p>
                For the fields which take email IDs, you can click on the <strong>Assigned To</strong>,
                <strong>CC</strong>, <strong>Submitted By</strong>, or <strong>Subscriber</strong> label 
                and select an email ID. <a name="Autocomplete"></a>If you enter a part of the 
                email ID for a user, the autocomplete function causes all available matching 
                IDs to be displayed. As in Outlook, you can also  use <strong>Ctrl-K</strong> to 
                autocomplete a partially entered email ID.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                If you type text in one of these fields, tBits provides a best-matched
                  drop  down hint list from among all the users and mailing lists
                  present in the 
                database in the format &quot;DisplayName &lt;user_ID &gt;&quot; or 
                &quot;LastName FirstName &lt;user_ID&gt;&quot;.</li>
                <li>
                    Autocomplete matching is based on the first name, the last name, or the email 
                    address. So, for example, if you type <em>john</em>, you will be presented with 
                    users for whom the first name, the last name, or the email ID starts with <em>john</em>.</li>
                <li>
                Use tab or enter to complete the email ID from the selected hint list.</li>
                <li>
                    Semicolon (;) and comma (,) are delimiters between email IDs.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>The autocomplete for Assigned To considers only the <a href="#AdministratorsRoles">category 
                    Assigned To</a> for that category and Domain .</p>
            <p><a name="BusinessAreaToolTip"></a>You can see some information about the Domain by holding the mouse over the Domain name in the web interface, including the prefix, the mailing list, and the administrators for that Domain . This also gives a link to a list of valid descriptors for the Domain . </p>
            <h3><a name="PreservingData"></a>Preserving Data On Changing Domains </h3>
            <p>On changing Domains in the Add New Request window or in the Search interface, a few of the  fields are preserved, so that the information you have entered is not lost.</p>
            <p>On adding a new request, some of the text fields are preserved: 
                  the CC, Description, Subject, Subscriber and Summary fields. </p>
            <p>In the normal Search interface, </p>
            <ul>
              <li>The CC, Subscriber, Submitted By,  and Updated By fields are preserved. The state of the <strong>Last Updated By</strong> checkbox  is also preserved: if it was checked, it will still be checked, and if it was off, it will still be off.</li>
              <li>The search text and the selection of where to search are  preserved; that is, in Subject, in All Text, and so on. </li>
              <li>If you select <strong>All</strong> for the Category, Request Type, Severity, or Status, that value is  retained on changing Domains .</li>
            </ul>
            <p>In the Advanced Search interface, the entered query is preserved. </p>
            <p>In a future version tBits will save other fields as well, such as Attachments.

            <h2><a name="EmailInterface"></a>Email Interface
            </h2>
            <p>Email from MS Outlook can be used to log a new request or reply to a request.
              When submitting a request, one must know the email ID for the Domain

                    <strong>Severity</strong>:
                    The default severity is medium. The severity can be  increased
                    using the exclamation point icon <img src="images/HighSeverity.gif" width="14" height="21">
                    in Outlook. The severity can be decreased using the down
                    arrow icon <img src="images/LowSeverity.gif" width="21" height="21">
                    in Outlook.The exact mapping of these Outlook settings to
                    tBits severities is  configurable in each Domain, so the
                    high severity icon might map to High 
                    in one Domain and Critical in another. You can also set the
                    severity via <a href="#InlineUpdateCommands">

                <li>
                    <strong>Subscribers</strong>: Any user added in the <strong>To:</strong> field 
                    of a new request submitted by email becomes a subscriber to that request; a user in the <strong>CC:</strong> field receives that message only, and not subsequent replies. On 
                    replies to a request, however, no subscribers are added from the <strong>To:</strong>
                    or the <strong>CC:</strong>
                fields of the email. If you specify other users on a reply, they receive only 
                that mail message.
				<p><strong>Note:</strong> To avoid sending duplicate email, use the <a href="#InlineUpdateCommands">IUC</a> /sub or /cc in the body of the message rather than using the <strong>To:</strong> or <strong>CC:</strong> field in email. </p>
                </li>

                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>You can set or update other fields via the web interface; alternatively, you can set them within the description text or via

            <p>To update a request about which tBits sent you email, simply reply to the email.
              An update to a request which involves only text and file attachments
              can be submitted with a simple email reply.
            tBits email relating to request activity includes a hyperlinked request
              number and has the same look as the Request Details page. In particular,
              there are
                direct links to <strong>Add Request</strong>, <strong>Update Request</strong>, <strong>
                    My Requests</strong>, and so on.
            </p>
            <p>If the email ID of another tBits Domain is specified in the <strong>CC: </strong>
                field using the web interface, the request is submitted in the other Domain as well, and the two requests are linked; see the description of <a href="#LinkedRequests">
                    linked requests</a>. This is only true for a new request, not for updates

            <ul>
                <li>
                The header of an Outlook reply is not included in the request system reply in 
                order to avoid repetition. To avoid loss of your input, do not remove the mail 
                header or reply inline to tBits mail messages. To deliberately include mail 
                histories, one can use the web interface, remove the header line from the 
                text to be appended, or attach a file including the mail in question.</li>
                <li>
                    Although Smart Tags work the same way in the email interface as in the 
                    web interface, other hyperlinks to web sites and to files follow the MS 
                    Outlook conventions when using the email interface. See the section on <a href="#SmartTags">

                upper right corner of the text. These can be used to navigate to other 
                requests. If the request was opened from a Search Results page then those 
                navigation arrows can be used to move through all the requests found in the 
                search, in the order displayed on the Search Results page. Otherwise, requests 
                are navigated in the order of their request number.

            <h3><a name="TrackingUnreadRequests"></a>Tracking Read/Unread Status of Requests</h3>
            <p>The tBits web interface keeps track of which requests have updates that you 
                haven't viewed yet, and which requests you've never viewed at all. On the 
                Search Results page, bold text is the indicator, with a double-arrow icon <img src="images/new.gif" width="16" height="16"> denoting a new request. On the Request Details page, unviewed updates are 
              outlined in a different <a href="#ColorIntBits">color</a>. tBits marks a request or an update as <em>read</em>
                when you open it in the web interface as well as when you open the 
                corresponding email message.

            <h3><a name="Logging"></a>Logging a New Request</h3>
            <p>The <strong>Add Request</strong> option is available from all the interface 
                pages in tBits. When adding (or submitting) a new request you should do the 
                following:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                Identify the correct Domain for the request. Select the correct
                  Domain before entering information about the request, as most
                  fields are cleared on <a href="#PreservingData">changing
                  Domain </a>. Only Subject, Description, Subscribers,  Cc, and Summary are 
                not cleared.</li>
                <li>
                If it is possible that there might already be notification about this problem, 
                such as &quot;The UNIX Chooser is not working this morning&quot;, search among the 
                existing requests to determine whether it is necessary to add a new request. If 
                a request has already been logged, you can reply to that one giving the details 
                you have observed. If not, you can add a new request.</li>
                <li>
                Specify a subject which summarizes the problem.</li>
                <li>
                Give a clear description of the request.</li>
                <li>
                If it would help to clarify the problem, for example in a bug report, attach a 
                file.</li>
                <li>
                    Specify a <a href="#Prioritization">severity</a>
                for the request. The default severity is medium.</li>
                <li>
                    If appropriate, specify subscribers, a due date and time, whether the request 
                    is private to the analysts for that Domain , and any other 
                    characteristics of that Domain which apply.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>On submitting a request, tBits sends email to the logger, subscribers, Assigned Tos 
                and CC entries, and to the analysts associated with that Domain ; these 
                details are <a href="#CustomizingDomain">configurable</a> for the Domain .
            </p>
            <p>Most of the options which are available on updating a request are available when 
                a request is submitted as well. For instance, <a href="#PrivateRequests">marking 
                    a request as private</a>, specifying a category if you are an analyst 
                for that Domain , using <a href="#SmartTags">smart tags</a>, using <a href="#InlineUpdateCommands">
                    IUCs</a> when submitting a request, 
                etc. If you do not have access to modify a field, then that field is greyed out 
            in the interface. </p>
            <p>If the email ID of another tBits Domain is specified in the <strong>CC: </strong>
                field using the web interface, the request is submitted in the other Domain as well, and the two requests are linked; see the description of <a href="#LinkedRequests">
                    linked requests</a>. This is true for new requests as well as for updates 
                to existing requests.
            </p>
            <p>Note that tBits displays the text of your request in a fixed width font, so 
                you can make use of newlines and spaces to create well-formatted requests. A 
                future version of tBits will support the Rich Text  format.

            <p>When you log a request, it's important to assign it an appropriate severity code 
                to indicate the degree of urgency. Please use the following guidelines:

            <p><B>Note:</B> Sometimes your requests may be re-prioritized depending on current 
                workload and other outstanding requests.</p>
            <h3><a name="Updating"></a>Updating a Request</h3>
            <p>In many cases, the update to a request is a reply: one submits a response to the 
                request without changing any of the request fields. To do this, one can use the 
                email or the web interface to tBits. For any other kind of update, use 
                the web interface, or see a description of additional support for inline and email updates 
                via <a href="#InlineUpdateCommands">IUCs</a> below. To use the web interface, 
                open the request using the link from the tBits-generated email about this 
                request, or by searching for the request in the web interface. Click <strong>Update 
                    Request </strong>and then you are able to add text, edit the subject, and 
                change other fields of the request. Even the Submitted By can be changed in some 
                cases. For example, you can add or update a summary, associate a parent with this 
                request, link a similar request to this request, close the request, change 
                field values, and suppress email all in the same update.
            </p>
            <p>This interface also has an <a href="#ParentSubRequests">Add Subrequest</a> and 
                an <a href="#Logging">Add Request</a> option.</p>
            <p>Email is always sent to the Assigned To, unless the Assigned To has <a href="#SettingsDialog">disabled email</a>. Other email options can be set by the 
                administrator of the Domain , and can be customized for particular 
                updates with the <strong>send email</strong> checkbox .
            </p>
            <h3><a name="PrivateRequests"></a>Private Requests
            </h3>
            <p>Requests can be marked as <em>private</em>. Only analysts for the Domain can view private requests. There can also be private categories 
                and private Domains in tBits; all of these are indicated by a 
            dagger icon: <img src="images/private_big.gif" width="16" height="16"></p>
            <p>The permissions associated with a private request are considered in the 
                context of your relationship to that request. A request is displayed in the 
                search results if you have permission to view the request:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                by virtue of your association with the Domain ; e.g. your role as an 
                analyst in that Domain .</li>
                <li>
                    by virtue of the contextual role you have for that request; e.g. your role as 
                    the Submitted By or as an Assigned To for the request.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>For example, if a Domain allows subscribers to view private 
                requests, you can view requests for which you are a subscriber even if your 
                status in that Domain would otherwise not allow you view permission for 
                that request.
            </p>
            <h3><a name="Drafts"></a>Drafts</h3>
            <p>You can save drafts of request updates in progress and reload them at a later 
                time. You can also configure tBits to autosave drafts of your updates at 
                fixed time intervals using the <a href="#SettingsDialog">Settings</a> page. The 
                primary purpose of this feature is to avoid losing updates in progress if you 
                accidentally close a browser window or if your browser crashes.</p>
            <p>
            The saved drafts are available from all pages. </p>
            <p>The following fields are saved in drafts:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Text fields:
                <ul>
                  <li>Description</li>

                  <li>Linked Requests</li>
                  <li>Parent</li>
                  <li>Private</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
            </ul>
            <h3><a name="Summaries"></a>Summaries</h3>
            <p>
                A summary can be added for a request from the Add Request or the Update Request 
                page. Click <strong>Summary</strong>, enter the summary text, and click <strong>Submit</strong>. 
                The summary is displayed with a greyed-out background at the top of the Request 
                Details page. This is especially useful for requests with many replies.
            </p>
            <h3><a name="ParentSubRequests"></a>Parents and Subrequests</h3>
            <p>A request can be associated with other requests in a parent/subrequest 
                relationship. You can add a parent to a request from the <strong>Add Request</strong>
                page or the <strong>Update Request</strong> page by clicking the <strong>Parent</strong>
                option; that is, the parent can be added either to a new or existing request. 
                To remove the relationship to this request, click <strong>Parent</strong> on 
                the <strong>Update Request</strong> page and enter 0.
            </p>
            <p>From the Request Details page, click <strong>Add Subrequest</strong> to log a 
                new subrequest of the request you are reading. The <strong>Add Request</strong> 
                form will open with the <strong>Parent</strong> field filled in.
            </p>
            <p>To create a parent/subrequest relationship for two existing requests, update the 
                subrequest and add the parent reference. From a parent, you can create a new 
                subrequest but you cannot make a previously existing request a subrequest.
            </p>
            <p>If the request you are looking at has a parent request and that parent has other 
                subrequests, they are called <strong>Siblings</strong> of the current request. 
                Note that a parent request can have many subrequests, but a subrequest can have 
                only a single parent request. Subrequests can have many sibling requests as 
                well.
            </p>
            <p>You can see parent and subrequest relationships in the <a href="#SearchResults">Search 
                    Results</a> page as well.</p>
            <p>More general links to requests are supported as well; see the description <a href="#LinkedRequests">
                    below</a>.</p>
            <h3><a name="SmartTags"></a>Smart Tags and Hyperlinks in Text
            </h3>
            <p>A smart tag is a notation that can be used in the body of a request to cause
              a  hyperlink to a request or to a particular reply to a request
              to be inserted in 
                the text. Smart tags can be used with both the email and web
              interfaces to  tBits. Smart tags are of the form <em>&lt;business_area_prefix&gt;#&lt;request_number&gt;</em>. 
                Note that there <strong>cannot be any spaces</strong> within this notation. So, 
                for instance, <em>Sys#69080</em> refers to request number 69080 in the Systems Domain. This notation can be used
                in the request number field when using the search interface for
                tBits, as well.
There are tool tips over  smart tags within tBits which display the subject of
          the request.            </p>
            <p>Within the body of a request, tBits also allows you to specify a URL for a 
                request, such as <em>http://tBits/Q/Sys/69080</em>, and tBits converts this 
                to the text <em>Sys#69080</em> with a hyperlink to the request.</p>
            <p>To link to a specific update within a request, append &quot;#&quot; and the update number: <em>
                    &lt;business_area_prefix&gt;#&lt;request_number&gt;#&lt;update_number&gt;</em>.
                     So, for instance, <em>http://tBits/Q/GenDev/746#5</em> or <em>GenDev#746#5</em>
                refers to update 5 for Request Number 746 in the General Domain
                .
            </p>
            <p>The notation <em>Update#&lt;update_number&gt;</em> is linked to the specified 
                update number within the same request. So <em>Update#6</em> causes a link to 
                the sixth update (or reply) to the current request. The notation <em>Request#&lt;request_number&gt;</em> or <em>Req#&lt;request_number&gt;</em> refers to a request number within the same Domain currently in use. </p>
            <p>In summary, you can use any of these notations to create a smart tag:</p>
            <ul>
              <li> <em>&lt;business_area_prefix&gt;#&lt;request_number&gt;<br>
                </em>For example, tBits turns <a href="http://tBits.tbitsglobal.com/Q/tBits/2675" target="_blank">tBits#2675</a> into a link to request number 2675 in the tBits Domain . </li>
            <li><em>&lt;business_area_prefix&gt;#&lt;request_number&gt;#&lt;update_number&gt;</em><br>
              For example, tBits turns <a href="http://tBits.tbitsglobal.com/Q/tBits/2675#1" target="_blank">tBits#2675#1</a> into a link to request number 2675, update 1, in the tBits Domain . </li>
            <li><em>Request#&lt;request_number&gt;</em> or <em>Req#&lt;request_number&gt;<br>
              </em>For example, tBits turns request#325 or req#325 into a link to request number 325 in the current Domain . </li>
            <li><em>Update#&lt;update_number&gt;</em><br>
              For example, tBits turns update#4 into a link to update number 4 in the current request.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Note that for other URLs, the method of making them a live link is similar to 
                Outlook. Specify <em>file://</em> and then the file path:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    A URL starting with <em>http</em>: or <em>www</em></li>
                <li>
                    A file or directory on a mapped drive X: or Z:, such as <em>file://X:\infra\build\doc</em>
                    or <em>file://Z:\infra\build\doc\tbits.htm</em></li>
                <li>
                  UNC notation, such as <em>file://\\tbitsglobal.com\proj</em></li>
            </ul>
            <p>Enclose a URL in quotes or angle brackets (&quot;&quot; or &lt;&gt;) to insert spaces or 
                any special characters. For UNC paths, comma and semicolon are delimiters 
                between paths, as are spaces. For all others, spaces or newlines are delimiters.</p>
            <p>The <em>file://</em> prefix is optional; you can substitute %20 for spaces. Within email, there are a number of Outlook restrictions in the creation of hyperlinks. </p>
            <h3><a name="LinkedRequests"></a>Linked Requests</h3>
            <p>tBits supports reciprocal links between similar requests: a request can be 
                linked to another request in any Domain . The relationship is transitive: 
                that is, if request A is related to request B, and request B is related to 
                request C, then request A is also related to request C.</p>
            <p>
                When viewing the Request Details page, one can view linked requests by putting 
                the mouse over the <strong>Link Requests</strong> tag; hyperlinked references 
                to the linked requests then become visible.             There are tool tips over  linked requests within tBits which display the subject of the request.</p>
            <p>On submitting or updating a request, click <strong>Link Requests</strong> to 
                specify requests which are related to this. Use <a href="#SmartTags">Smart Tags</a>
                to specify the linked requests. If there are multiple requests, they can be 
                separated with commas. For example, you can specify:
            </p>
            <blockquote>Sys#3501, Sys#12305, Sys#3406#12</blockquote>
            <p>You cannot specify fully qualified URLs.
            </p>
            <p>If the email ID of another tBits Domain is specified in the <strong>CC: </strong>
                field using the web interface, the request is submitted in the other Domain as well, and the two requests are linked.
            </p>
            <p><a href="#ParentSubRequests">Parent subrequest relationships</a> are also still 
                supported in tBits, within the same Domain .
            </p>
            <h3><a name="PrimaryAssigned To"></a>Primary Assigned To</h3>
            <p>As before, requests can have multiple Assigned Tos. It is possible to designate one 
                of multiple Assigned Tos as <strong>primary</strong> by putting a <strong>*</strong>
                before the email ID. This can help groups assign ultimate responsibility to a 
                single person.</p>
            <p>The My Requests tab of the Search interface can be changed to select requests
               for which you are the primary Assigned To, in addition to the other
              options 
                (Submitted By, Assigned To, subscriber, or any subset of these).
              If you search based on your being the primary Assigned To, the
              results will
              also
              include requests for 
                which you are the only Assigned To.
            </p>
            <p>There can be only one primary Assigned To. If multiple users are specified as
               primary Assigned To, only the first is selected.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Note</strong>: One cannot select requests with a specified primary 
                Assigned To from the other tabs of the Search interface; only
              with the My Requests tab.</p>
            <h3><a name="TransferringRequests"></a>Transferring Requests to Other Domains </h3>
            <p>    It is common for tBits requests to be submitted in the wrong Domain . The
			Request Details view includes a simple option Transfer Request. Clicking on this
			causes a dialog to be opened. Select the  Domain to which the request should be transferred, enter any details
			required, and click Submit. The information added in this dialog applies to the new request. </p>
            <p>
			The old request is closed with text describing the transfer of the request to a different
			Domain , and includes a smart link to the new request.  For the old request,
			updates without any description or summary on the closed request are allowed;  no 
			descriptions or summary changes are accepted. Any IUCs or email replies sent for the original request are redirected to the new request; this is done iteratively, should the original request be transferred more than once. </p>
            <p>The new request  includes
			  a smart link to the old Domain and all the request history from
              the original request. The new request is submitted by the original
              Submitter, but updated by the person who	transferred the request.</p>
            <h3><a name="SimultaneousUpdates"></a>Conflict Resolution For Simultaneous Request 
                Updates</h3>
            <p>If two people try to update the fields of a request at the same time (e.g. to 
                change the category or subject), the second person gets a warning about the 
                conflicts and is offered a resolution method to avoid losing the first person's 
                changes. There is a Conflicting Updates dialog which offers you the opportunity 
                to review each conflict in field values before submitting your update to the 
                request. The dialog lists the values that you have specified for each field 
                which is in conflict with another update. You can view the newer updates by 
                clicking on the links in the table, if you wish.</p>
            <p>You can select each field value individually.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Click <strong>Submit</strong> to submit the update to the request with the 
                    values you have selected.                    <br>
              </li>
                <li>
                    Click <strong>Apply</strong> if you want to select values for each field in the 
                    dialog and return to the Update Request form for further modifications.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    In this case, the Update Request form will be updated with the values you 
                    selected for the field values. You might want to use this option if you wish to 
                    add to the description text of the update.                    <br>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Click <strong>Cancel</strong> to return to the Update Request page.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>Note that tBits does this checking only when an update is submitted using the 
                web interface; it does not check email updates to requests for conflicting 
                simultaneous updates. If there are simultaneous updates and the second is 
                submitted by email, it is accepted as is. Therefore, caution should be 
                exercised in the use of <a href="#InlineUpdateCommands">IUCs</a>.
            </p>
            <p>Also note that tBits does not check again for conflicts when you click <strong>Submit</strong>, 
                so it is possible to fool the system, particularly if there is a long time 
                interval between opening the dialog and clicking <strong>Submit</strong>. 
                Similarly, if you click <strong>Apply</strong>, note that any further changes 
                you make in the Update Request form are not checked for conflicts against 
                updates by other users.
            </p>
            <p>Additionally, if a reply is sent via email to an earlier update, then text is 
                inserted next to the update number and email ID identifying the update to which 
                this is a response. For instance, if there is an email reply to update 3, but 
                there is also an update 4 recorded, the text &quot;[in reply to Update#3]&quot; is added 
                in update number 5. This helps to clarify the relationship between the replies.</p>

            <p>The tBits <a href="#SearchLevels">Search interface</a> has four tabs: Search, Advanced Search, All Domain Search, and My Requests. From the Search interface, you 
                can search for a request based on any of the request fields or text stored for 
                that request.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Note: </strong>First specify the Domain , as the fields are 
                cleared on changing Domains .
            </p>
            <p>If you specify a search string, it applies to the parts of the request 
                specified, which can be selected from the pull-down menu to the right of the 
                search string. For example, you can specify the subject, the summary, or all 
                text. All words are &quot;and&quot;ed together; that is, all the words specified must be 
                present in the text for search to select a request. You can select values for 
                any of the request fields as well. The various data you provide for the request 
                fields are also &quot;and&quot;ed; that is, all must be present for search to select a 
                request.
				   You can search for any character within the subject of a request, 
			   but within the description of a request, only for 
			   alphanumeric characters. 
            </p>
            <p>You can click on <strong>Save Search&hellip;</strong> to save a search; you 
                then give it a name, which you can select later. The saved search applies only 
                to the Domain which was open when you saved the search. This feature is 
                described in detail <a href="#SavedSearches">below</a>.
            </p>
            <p>If you enter a number in the Request field, a request in the specified Domain
              is opened. If you know the Domain prefix and request number, you
              can specify the Domain prefix, then #, then a request number to
              display
                the request without selecting the Domain . For instance, you
              could have the Domain 'B' open, but if you enter <em>A#123</em> in the 
            Request field, then 'A' Domain request 123 is opened. </p>
            <h3><a name="SearchLevels"></a><a name="SearchAllDomains"></a>Search Interface Levels</h3>
            <p>There are three search levels to the search interface within the tBits search 
                tab: <b>Search</b>, <b>Advanced Search</b>, and<b> <strong>All Domain Search</strong></b>. The default is Search. 
                You can access any level by clicking its name; the interface expands or 
                contracts to reflect your new choice.  Note that for Search or Advanced Search, first 
                specify the Domain .
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <b>Search</b> is the default search level. It provides access to the most important search fields: allowing you 
                    to search by Request Number, by a search string, specifying what aspects of a 
                    request you want to search, and the Domain you want to search. It also provides the ability to search by the standard fields for all Domains , as well as by the person who last updated the request.
                    <br>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Advanced Search</strong> is the most comprehensive access level. It provides all of the 
                    access that <b>Search</b> does, and adds the ability to search by the date and 
                    time the request was submitted and/or last updated as well as by the custom 
                    fields for that Domain . It also includes a <a href="#QueryLanguage">TQL</a>
                    Builder. You can select the fields and values which you would like to specify 
                    in your search, click <strong>Add to Query</strong>, and the corresponding TQL 
                    is generated in the text box below. Once your search expression is complete, 
                    click <strong>Search</strong> to effect the search.
                    <br>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>All Domain Search </strong> allows
                    a search of all Domains at once. The interface is similar
                    to the Search panel, but allows you to search in
                    all the Domains in this tBits database in a single operation.<br>
              </li>
                <li>
                    The <a href="#MyRequests">My Requests</a> tab of the Search interface is the 
                    default page within tBits; it provides an easy way to view the requests 
                    associated with you in all Domains .</li>

            <p>The search fields available in the <b>Search</b> tab for a  Domain with the standard fields correspond to the request fields maintained for the Domain , as described 
                in the <a href="#RequestFields">Request Fields</a> section. Entering or 
                selecting options within these fields restricts searches in the manner 
                indicated below. The request fields are cleared when you change Domains , 
                so you should select the Domain you want to search first before 
                specifying other fields, to avoid the loss of information.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    You can enter multiple request numbers, Submitted by, Assigned
                      To, subscribers, etc. by separating them with a comma or
                      a
                      semicolon. tBits
                      uses a comma to 
                    separate entries within a field, so it will provide a new
                      drop-down selection  menu for selecting a possible entry
                      after each semicolon or comma. Once you 
                    have clicked Search, it will also understand entries separated
                      by a comma or  semicolon.<br>
                </li>
                <li>
                    If you enter &quot;&quot; (two double quotes with nothing between them) into any search 
                    field, you will receive results whose corresponding entries are blank. Note 
                    that if you just leave a field blank, your search will simply ignore that 
                    field, rather than return entries for which the entry is blank.
                    <br></li>
                <li>
                    You can use a comma (,) to escape autocompletion if you need to enter a value 
                    that does not exist in the list used for autocompletion (for example, finding 
                    requests assigned to users who no longer work here).

            </ul>
            <h3><a name="SearchResults"></a>The Search Results Page
            </h3>
            <p>Each of the request fields is displayed in a separate column. Results are 
                displayed by default in descending order of the request number; you can change 
                this by clicking on the column header that you want to use for sorting. An 
                arrow is displayed in the column header used for sorting; click on the arrow to 
                toggle between descending and ascending order, or click on a different column 
                header to sort by the value of that field. The request numbers and subjects 
                have hyperlinks to the actual request.
            </p>
            <p>The Search Results page has been designed to make it easy to identify relevant 
                requests. For example:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Both the request number and the subject text are hyperlinked to the request in 
                    the search results. In addition, a context-sensitive menu appears when your 
                    mouse is over a request number, allowing you to view or update the request, or 
                    to add a subrequest.

                    clicking <b>Configure Search Results&hellip;</b> and choosing what columns of data you would like to 
                    display. You can also specify which field should be used for sorting the

                    Each severity is associated with an <a href="#Legend">icon</a> in the search results. The severity 
                    column header has an icon similar to the MS Outlook importance flag. If a 
                    request has a severity of Critical, the request number is displayed in bold 
                    font and red color.<br></li>
                <li>
                    If a request is past the due date, an alarm icon is displayed to the right of 
                    the request number: <img src="images/alarm_big.gif" width="16" height="16"><br>

                <li><a name="ParentSubrequestTree"></a>
                    If any of the matching requests has parent requests or subrequests, all parent requests are displayed, as are those subrequests that match the search criteria, with the tree structure of their relationships indicated. If the <img src="images/inc-hier.gif" width="16" height="16" style="margin-bottom:-5 "> icon is displayed, then there are subrequests which are not displayed. Click on the icon to display the fully expanded tree. Requests which do not explicitly match the search criteria are indicated in grey. <br>

                <li>
                    You can display all requests matching your search, regardless of number, on one 
                    page. The default is to break them up by a number specified as <strong>Results Per 
                        Page</strong> within your <a href="#SettingsDialog">Settings</a> page. You can 
                    check the <strong>List All </strong> checkbox  on the Search Results page to display all on a 
                    single page. However, in the case of listing all requests, there is a <a href="#SearchLargeNumbers">limit of 1000 results</a>; this is for performance reasons.

                    Private requests, private categories, and private Domains are indicated by a dagger icon: <img src="images/private_big.gif" width="16" height="16"><br>
                    <br>
                    The permissions associated with a private request are considered in the 
                    context of your relationship to that request. A request is displayed in the 
                    search results if you have permission to view the request:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                        by virtue of your association with the Domain .</li>
                        <li>
                            by virtue of the contextual role you are in.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    For example, if a Domain allows subscribers to view private 
                    requests, you can view requests for which you are a subscriber even if your 
                    status in that Domain would otherwise not allow you view permission for 
                    that request.

                <li>
                    Search results are refreshed automatically. The duration between autorefreshes

                    If you have permission to set the status or severity of requests in that 
                    Domain , there is a check box next to each request number, and you can 
                    select <strong>Mark selected requests as</strong> closed, private or 
                    public. These are called <a href="#BulkUpdates">Bulk Request Updates</a>.

            <p>Search results can be exported to excel by clicking on the <strong>Export to Excel</strong> link above the search results. 
</p>
<p>All the top-level requests that matched the search criteria are exported. The maximum number of results that can be exported  is <a href="#SearchLargeNumbers">limited to 1000</a>, the maximum number of results that can be rendered in search. No matter what page of search results is displayed, the first 1000 results are exported.
</p>
<p>Note these differences between the display in the tBits web interface and in Excel: </p>
<ul>
<li>
   The private property of requests is not displayed to facilitate sorting on the request field.</li>
   <li>The Submitted By, Assigned To,  Subscriber, To, and Cc lists are displayed in a single column, again for ease of sorting. </li>
   <li>Severities are displayed with the following color associations:
     <ul><li><span class="style1"> Critical</span>: Red, Bold </li>
        <li><span class="style2">High</span>:  Red, Normal </li>
        <li>Medium: Default color(black), Normal </li>
        <li><span class="style3">Low</span>: Green, Bold </li>
        <li><span class="style4">Very Low</span>: Green, Normal </li></ul>
</li>       
<li>The following headers are displayed at the top of the Excel sheet:
  <ul><li> Domain </li> 
   <li>The TQL query used to generate the results in the sheet and the saved search name, if any. </li>
   <li>The date on which the Excel sheet was generated. </li>
  </ul></li></ul>
    
<p>By default, the columns, sort field, and sort order are taken from your configuration in that Domain , but you can specify these with the <a href="#QueryLanguage">TQL</a> descriptors <code>disphdr</code>, <code>sortfield</code> and <code>sortorder</code>.  

For example:</p>
<blockquote><code>status:(open, active) subject:&quot;[3.0&quot; disphdr:request,category,subject,dueby,Assigned To,Submitted By sortfield:dueby
    sortorder:asc</code></blockquote>

            <p>The <strong>My Requests</strong> page provides an easy way to view the requests 
            associated with you in all Domains. </p>
            <p>Use the checkboxes next to <b>Display requests where </b>to instruct the page to 
                display requests with you in a different role (<a href="#Terminology">Submitted By, Subscriber, Assigned To</a>, 
                and/or <a href="#PrimaryAssigned To">Primary Assigned To</a>). The result is that you will see requests for which you have any of the roles selected. You can also change the default filter selected on 
                the <a href="#SettingsDialog">Settings</a> page.</p>
            <p>
                Use the <b>View &amp; change status filter </b>link and dialog to instruct the 
                page to display requests with a different set of statuses (for example, active, 
                suspended, or closed) for each Domain . You can select multiple statuses,

            <p>You can <b>save</b> a search (i.e. the search string and set of field values 
                that generated a set of results). To use this feature:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Make your search using the search interface, and click <b>Save Search&hellip;</b>
                at the bottom of the search interface.</li>
                <li>
                    A dialog asking you to name your search will appear.
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                        Provide a name.</li>
                        <li>
                            Check the checkbox next to <strong>Set as default</strong>
                        if you wish the search parameters provided in this search to be set by default 
                        whenever you use the search interface.</li>
                        <li>
                            Check the checkbox next to <strong>Mark as shared</strong> if you wish to share 
                            this search with other users of this Domain . By default the search 
                            is private; it cannot be shared with other users.                        </li>
                        <li>Domain analysts can check the checkbox next to <strong>Mark
                                as public</strong>  to make the search public. It will be displayed
                                with other saved searches for any user of this Domain . </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Click <strong>Save</strong>.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>The search is saved for you for this Domain . This feature is particularly
                useful for creating a default set of search  parameters.            </p>
            <p>There cannot be two saved searches of the same name for a single user
                or within a Domain . If there is both a user-defined search and a Domain search with the same name, the user-defined search is given priority. </p>
            <p>You can save a search  as a <em>shared</em> search or a<em> public</em> search ,
                so it can be used by other users of the Domain as well. By default it
                is saved as a private search, visible only to you. A shared search can be accessed
                by  other users, but only if you inform them of its existence. tBits only
                 displays the searches you have defined yourself and  public searches. The
                syntax for accessing a shared search defined by another user is given <a href="#AccessPublicSearch">below</a>.</p>
            <p>Click <strong>My Searches </strong> to bring up the Saved Searches dialog. The default 
                search name is displayed in bold text. A private search is indicated with 
                the dagger icon<img src="images/private_big.gif" width="16" height="16">, as for <a href="#PrivateRequests">private requests</a> 
                and other private parts of tBits. Use this dialog to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                Select a saved search  to perform a search by clicking on the name.</li>
                <li>
                Set a saved search as the default search using the pull-down menu. You can also set 
                tBits to have no default search with this pull-down menu.</li>
                <li>
                    Mark a saved search as shared by checking the checkbox in the <strong>Shared</strong>
                column, or as private by unchecking it.</li>
                <li>
                    Delete a saved search by clicking the icon in the <strong>Delete</strong> column.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Saved searches that you defined yourself can be directly opened using the following
                syntax in the browser address bar:
            </p>
            <blockquote><pre>http://tBits/search/&lt;business_area_prefix&gt;/&lt;search_name&gt;</pre></blockquote>
            <p>For example,</p>
            <blockquote><pre>http://tBits/search/tBits/my_open_active_tickets</pre></blockquote>
            <p>
                <a name="AccessPublicSearch"></a>You can access a shared search of another 
                user using this syntax:
            </p>
            <blockquote>
              <pre>http://tBits/search/&lt;business_area_prefix&gt;/&lt;user_ID&gt;:&lt;search_name&gt; </pre>
            </blockquote>
            <p>You can access a public search using this syntax:</p>
            <blockquote>
              <pre>http://tBits/search/&lt;DomainPrefix&gt;/Domain:&lt;Search&gt;</pre>
		  </blockquote>
            <p>For example,</p>
            <blockquote><pre>http://tBits/search/tBits/vaibhav:tBits_devfixed
http://tBits/search/sys/Domain:helpdesk </pre></blockquote>
			<p>When you select a shared or a public search, your browser address bar is updated with
			    the syntax needed to access that search. You can copy the address and send
			    it to other users to allow them access to your shared search. </p>
            <h3><a name="SearchLargeNumbers"></a>Handling Large Numbers of Search Results
            </h3>
            <p>Because retrieving a large number of search results is very resource-intensive 
                and can be quite slow, a search query retrieves only the number of rows to be displayed in one page, but 
                maintains the count of requests that actually matched the search criteria. For 
                example, if 2020 requests match the search criteria and you have selected 1000 results per page, then only the top 1000 results 
                are retrieved from the database and the result comment is <strong>1 - 1000 of 2020</strong>. If the matched request count is less than the number of requests per page, say 550, 
                then the result comment is <strong>550 requests matched</strong>.</p>
            <p>You can configure the number of search results to display on the <strong>Settings</strong>
                page.
            </p>
            <p>If you change the sorting of your search results by clicking on a column header, 
                tBits considers all requests which match the search criteria, not just those which were initially retrieved.

            <h3><a name="AutomaticAssignment"></a>Automatic Assignment</h3>
            <p>The <em>volunteer</em> setting allows Domains which receive a large 
                volume of requests to automatically assign the volunteer analysts
              to new  requests in an impartial, round-robin fashion, or by random
              selection. To avoid 
                automatic assignment, you can set your status to <strong>On Vacation</strong> from 
                the <a href="#SettingsDialog">Settings</a> page. A request is assigned 
                automatically if the request is given <strong>auto</strong> as the Assigned To. 
                The assignment method is set on the <strong>Properties</strong> page in the 
                Admin area. If the assignment method is <strong>
                    none</strong> then automatic
                    assignment of requests is disabled.

            <h3><a name="BulkUpdates"></a>Bulk Request Updates
            </h3>
            <p>The Domain can also be configured to allow bulk request updates.</p>
            <p>
                Conceptually, a bulk request update moves a set of requests to a common state. 
                For example,</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                Mark all QA-Reviewed requests as Closed.</li>
                <li>
                    Mark all requests in the &quot;Release&quot; category as Private.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>You can perform a bulk request update if you are authorized to change either the 
                status or private field or both in a Domain . If you are authorized 
                to change those characteristics, you will see checkboxes for selection to the 
                left of the request number in the search results. One or more requests can be 
                selected to perform a bulk request update. Check the checkbox at the top of the column to select all  displayed requests. Note that if there are multiple pages of requests,  only those currently displayed are selected. </p>
            <p>You can mark a group of requests as read or unread if you have <a href="#ConfigureDialog">
                    configured</a> the Domain to track read and unread requests.
            </p>
            <p>If bulk request updates are allowed, then in the <a href="#SearchResults">Search 
                    Results page</a>, you can select a set of requests by checking the checkbox 
                next to their description. Use the pull-down menu to select the status you 
                would like to apply to the selected requests; this will be one of
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                Closed</li>
                <li>
                Public</li>
                <li>
                Private</li>
                <li>
                Read</li>
                <li>Unread</li>
            </ul>
            <p>You can also add a custom description. Click <strong>Submit</strong> to effect 
                the change.</p>
            <p>An advanced bulk request update interface is provided in tBits to change the 
                following fields of the selected requests; only those authorized to change 
                these fields can make use of this option. Click <strong>More</strong> to make 
                changes to these fields:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                Category</li>
                <li>
                Status</li>
                <li>
                Severity</li>
                <li>
                    Request Type</li>
            </ul>
            <p>You can also change the private status of the selected requests, and add text 
                in the description. The description is added to each of the selected requests.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Note:</strong> Bulk request updates do not follow the <a href="#BusinessRules">
                    business rules</a> for the Domain . They do follow the permissions 
                for that area, however. So, for instance, if you are authorized to close 
                requests but the business rule &quot;Do not allow pending requests to be closed&quot; is 
                in effect, a bulk request update to close all selected requests will succeed, 
                even if some are pending.</p>
            <h3><a name="Permissions"></a>Permissions
            </h3>
            <p>The default configuration of a Domain allocates access to the fields of a 
                request as detailed here. Access rights include those of a general
              user for all  other roles; for example, a Submitted By has all
              the access rights that a general 
                user has as well as those for a person submitting the request.
              Access for the roles of User, Submitted By, and Subscriber is defined
              by your
              association
              with
              the request. Access for the 
                roles of Assigned To,  Analyst and Manager is explicitly granted
              for the entire  Domain .
</p>
            <p>A mailing list can be used to allot access rights to a Domain . 
    In that case, any member of that mailing list is allotted the permissions 
    given to the mailing list. The absolute access rights of the user are a union 
    of all the access roles allotted, directly to that email ID and to mailing 
    lists which include the email ID. 
In case that a mailing list includes another mailing list, the mailing lists are exhaustively expanded to give those access rights to all members of the mailing list. </p>
            <p>A tBits Domain can be configured to be totally private; only users 
                with View access to that Domain can read requests submitted.</p>
            <p>Note that an Analyst is someone who is designated as a role analyst for the 
                Domain . An Assigned To in this table refers to an Assigned To for this 
                request.You can view your Assigned To relationships by clicking <strong>View My Domain 
                    Profile</strong> on the <a href="#SettingsDialog">Settings</a> page.</p>

            <p>IUCs allow Domain analysts to update request fields (e.g. Status, 
                Assigned To,  Due Date, etc.) inline within the description of a request update and within email replies, using a special syntax.</p>
            <p>IUCs provide a  notation to allow the specification of settings for most request 
                fields from within the body of an update, whether submitted through the web or through email. This notation must appear at 
                the start or the end of the message, or can be used in both places. At the start of the message, once any text which is not of this syntax appears in 
                the message, any further text is treated as the request description. Similarly, starting from the end of the message, only lines at the end which are purely IUC lines are considered update commands; any non-IUC lines demarcate the description portion of the update from the ending IUCs. </p>
            <p>This 
                  feature can be enabled for users of the Domain by the <a href="#AdministratorsRoles">
                      tBits development team</a>, and the exact syntax of each IUC descriptor is <a href="#CustomizingDomain">
                      configurable</a> for the Domain . See the IUC Descriptor Table link for the Domain for a  list of supported field descriptors and the supported list type field values, or the  <a href="#Descriptors">descriptor</a> table above for a list of common descriptors. The meaning of the descriptors can be inferred from the long versions. </p>
            <p>Acceptable values vary with the kind of field which is to be updated. For  fields which take a single value, the value must have the notation:</p>
            <blockquote><code> /descriptor:value</code></blockquote>
            <p>For a field which can accept more than one value, the value can be <em>absolute</em> or <em>relative</em>, as defined in the following table:</p>
            <table border=1>
			  <tr><th>Notation</th><th>Description</th></tr>
              <tr><td> <code>/descriptor:value_or_list  </code></td>
              <td rowspan="2"> Appends value to the existing list if not present. </td>
              </tr>
              <tr><td> <code>/descriptor:+value_or_list </code> </td>
              </tr>
              <tr><td><code>/descriptor:-value_or_list </code></td>
              <td> Removes the value from the existing list if present.</td>
              </tr>
              <tr><td><code>/descriptor:=value_or_list </code></td>
              <td> Clears the existing list and sets the field value to the new list specified. This notation can be used for fields which take a single value also. </td>
              </tr>
            </table>
			<p>For absolute notation, specify a slash and one of the descriptors, followed 
                by a colon (:), an equal sign (=) and/or white space and then a value. If there are multiple values, separate them with a comma, a semicolon, or white space. For example:</p>
                <blockquote>
                  <p><code>/category:purchasing<br>
            	/status closed<br>
				/subscribers: milton,smythe<br>
				/Assigned To = jones bart </code></p>
                </blockquote>

                <p>The descriptors for fields and for list type values are case-insensitive; you can write /due or /Due or /DUE with 
                the same effect. No quoting is required; the value is considered to be the text from the descriptor to the end of the line in the case of a text field. For example, you can use either of the following IUCs:</p>
                <blockquote>
                  <p><code>/subject: [3.5] Descriptor updates for this section. <br>
    /subscribers: tBits-dev@hyd </code></p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>Minimal IUC matching is supported: if the beginning of a descriptor is unambiguous, then a prefix of the descriptor name can be used. The prefix must have a minimum of three characters. So, for example, &quot;<code>sta</code>&quot; or &quot;<code>stat</code>&quot; or &quot;<code>statu</code>&quot; are unique prefixes for the field &quot;<code>status</code>&quot; in the standard Domain configuration. Note that &quot;<code>sub</code>&quot; is defined as a descriptor for &quot;<code>subscribers</code>&quot; in the standard tBits configuration, so, although normally &quot;<code>sub</code>&quot; would be ambiguous as it matches both &quot;<code>subscribers</code>&quot; and &quot;<code>subject</code>&quot;, in fact, &quot;<code>/sub</code>&quot; can be used to mean &quot;<code>/subscribers</code>&quot;. Minimal matching applies to the descriptors for list type field values as well, so <code>&quot;/sta:clos</code>&quot; matches &quot;<code>sta</code>&quot; to &quot;<code>status</code>&quot; and &quot;<code>clos</code>&quot; to &quot;<code>closed</code>&quot;. See the table <a href="#IUCMinimalMatchExamples">below</a> for examples. Note  that a descriptor can be defined with fewer than 3 characters, and in that case, the full descriptor name matches, even though the length is less than three. </p>
                <p>If the descriptor for a list type field value is unambiguous, then that can also be used as an IUC. So, for example, </p>
                <blockquote>
                  <p> <code>/closed</code></p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>is equivalent to</p>
          <blockquote>
            <p><code>/status closed</code></p>
          </blockquote>
                <p>This can be used in combination with the minimal matching facility. So, for example, if the category includes the values &quot;<code>unix_server</code>&quot; and &quot;<code>unix_client</code>&quot;, then an IUC of &quot;<code>/unix</code>&quot; is ambiguous, but &quot;<code>/unix_c</code>&quot; uniquely is identified as &quot;<code>/cat:unix_client</code>&quot;. </p>
                <p>The value of a field can be <a href="#ClearIUCField">cleared</a> using an equal sign and no argument, or by providing an empty string as the descriptor argument.</p>

                <p>Note the following usage conventions:</p>
            <ul>
                <li> If you use &quot;=&quot; on a line, you cannot use &quot;+&quot; or &quot;-&quot;.</li>
                <li>
                You cannot use the &quot;-&quot; on a CC line, or for a value which is not already in 
                that field.</li>
                <li>If you specify request field of a list type like severity, you can specify 
                exactly one value, and the spelling of the value must match exactly.</li>
                <li>
                If you specify the /subject descriptor, the text you specify after the 
                descriptor is used as the new subject of the request.</li>
                <li>
                Use the /mail descriptor to specify whether to notify by email (Yes) or not 
                (No).</li>
                <li>
                It is a good practice to insert a blank line between all the IUC descriptors and 
                the text of the request update.</li>
                <li>
                    You cannot make a private request public with an IUC descriptor.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>Note that request field changes made via IUCs are  checked by tBits for <a href="#SimultaneousUpdates">
                    conflicting simultaneous updates</a>, but there is no table provided with information about the conflicts, so caution should be exercised in the 
                use of IUCs. In particular, ascertain that the current value of request fields 
                that you intend to change when submitting an update with IUCs.
</p>
            <p>Errors in the use of IUCs in email result in an email notification of the error. </p>
            <h4><a name="IUCPrecedence"></a>IUC Precedence</h4>
            <p>IUCs can appear at the start and the end of the description portion of an update. Within the web interface, the same fields can also be set using the web selections. Should the same field be set in more than one place, the precedence, from low to high, is as follows:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Set with web interface</li>
            <li>Start of update</li>
            <li>End of update</li>
            </ul>
            <p>If the IUC descriptor can take only a single value or if absolute notation is used, the last value given is used. For example, there can be only one Severity for a request. If the IUC descriptor can take multiple values, and if additive notation is used, the precedence goes through all the specified values from the start to end of the precedence list, and the final result is the value.</p>
            <p>Note the following:</p>
            <ul>
              <li> If a descriptor can take more than one value, such as a subscriber list, all the values can appear on the same line. Multiple values can be separated by commas, semicolons, or white space.<br>
    For example, <br>
    <span style="MARGIN-LEFT:1cm"><code>/log: vinodg ritesh</code></span> <br>
    Alternatively, you can use additive notation. </li>
              <li> If a descriptor appears more than once and absolute notation is used, only the last occurrence of the descriptor is used. <br>
    For example, in this sequence, only the later log descriptor is used:<br>
    <span style="MARGIN-LEFT:1cm"><code>/log: vinodg </code></span> <code><br>
    <span style="MARGIN-LEFT:1cm">/assign: +ritesht </span> <br>
    <span style="MARGIN-LEFT:1cm">/log: ritesh </span></code></li>
            </ul>
            <p>For example, suppose that the following values are specified in a single update:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>In the web interface:<br>
              <blockquote><code>severity: high<br>
              status: open
              <br>
              category: bug
              <br>
              AssignedTo:
				jessica<br> 
			  subscriber: norman</code></blockquote>
			  </li>
            <li> At the start of the update description:<br>
              <blockquote><code>/sev:low<br>
              /AssignedTo:+jason</code></blockquote>
            </li>
            <li>At the end of the update description:<br>
              <blockquote><code>/stat: pending_qa<br>
              /sub=ashley<br>
              /ass:+sita,-jason<br>
              /stat:reviewed</code></blockquote>
            </li>
            </ul>
            <p>Then the final settings would be</p>
            <ul>
              <li><code>severity: high</code></li>
            <li><code>status: reviewed </code></li>
            <li><code>category: bug</code></li>
            <li><code>   AssignedTo: jessica, sita</code></li>

            <p>TQL is a specialized language for submitting queries to tBits. It provides you 
                with a flexible way of defining and storing queries.
            </p>
            <p>For example, you can:</p>
            <ul style="LIST-STYLE-TYPE:none">
                <li>
                Search for requests where both vaibhav and ritesh are Assigned
                  To's.</li>
                <li>
                Search for requests due in the next week.</li>
                <li>
                    Search for requests you updated in the last month.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                The <a href="#AdvancedSearch">Advanced Search Query Builder</a> generates TQL. 
                You can type TQL directly in the text box, or use the query builder to enter it 
                for you. 
            </p>
            <p>For example, you can specify
            </p>
            <pre style="MARGIN-LEFT:1cm">category:Pending -stat:closed</pre>
            <p>to search for queries with a category of Pending and a status of not closed.
            </p>
            <p>If you use the query builder, the fields available to you depend on the field 
                type and on the value you select. The date field selectors are particularly 
                expressive. For instance, if you select a field with a date type such as a due 
                date:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    You might select a value like <strong>Today</strong>, in which case you are 
                done;</li>
                <li>
                    You might select a date range like <strong>Between</strong>, in which case 
                you are prompted a &quot;from&quot; and a &quot;to&quot; date, using a calendar browser;</li>
                <li>
                    You might select <strong>Last 'n' days</strong> or <strong>Next 'n' weeks</strong>, 
                    in which case you are prompted for the value of <strong>'n'</strong>. You might 
                    want to say <strong>Last 4 days</strong> so then you would enter <strong>4</strong>
                    in the text box that appears after the <strong>Next 'n' days</strong> selection.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4><a name="WritingTQL"></a>Writing TQL Queries</h4>
            <p>A simple TQL query consists of a <a href="#Descriptors">descriptor</a>, a colon, 
                and an argument or argument list. The colon is mandatory. A descriptor can be 
                considered an abbreviation for a request field name or list type value name in a Domain . There are some standard descriptors, but they can be set on a Domain basis. An 
                argument list has a comma as a separator.  </p>
            <p>For example,</p>
			<table border="1">
				<tr><th>Field name</th><th>Descriptor</th></tr>
				<tr><td>Category</td><td><code>cat</code></td>
				</tr>
				<tr><td>Submitted By</td><td><code>log</code></td>
				</tr>
				<tr><td>Due Date</td><td><code>due</code></td>
				</tr>
			</table>

            <p>The notation accepted for TQL queries is as outlined here:</p>
            <p>For single-valued fields:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><code>field:value </code></li>
              <li><code> field:comma-separated list of values</code></li>
            </ul>
          <p>For multi-valued fields:      </p>
            <ul>
              <li><code>descriptor:value</code></li>
              <li><code> descriptor:value1,value2 </code></li>
              <li><code>descriptor:value1 AND value2 </code></li>
              <li><code> descriptor:value1 OR value2</code></li>
              <li><code>descriptor:value1 NOT value2</code></li>
              <li> <code>has:descriptor</code>  (to check that the value of the field is not empty)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The patterns in which arguments can be specified with the descriptors depend on the type of the descriptor and are listed in the <a href="#Patterns">Argument Patterns</a> section. Complex queries can be formed by joining simple queries using the logical 
                operators AND, OR and NOT. A minus (-) before a TQL query is synonymous with 
            NOT. <a href="#Grouping">Parentheses</a> can be used to create yet more complex queries.</p>
            <p>Parameters which include a colon (:), a hyphen (-), square bracket ([]), or a space ( ) must be enclosed within quotes. The one exception is that dates can be specified with a hyphen.</p>
            <p>For example:</p>
            <ul>
              <li> <code>category:pending </code><br>
                  <span style="MARGIN-LEFT:5mm">Search for requests in the &quot;pending&quot; category.</span><br>
              </li>
              <li><code> category:server AND Assigned To:vaibhav </code><br>
                  <span style="MARGIN-LEFT:5mm">Search for requests in the &quot;server&quot; category that are assigned to &quot;vaibhav&quot;.<br>
              </span></li>
              <li><code> AssignedTo:vaibhav NOT status:closed </code><br>
                  <span style="MARGIN-LEFT:5mm">Search for requests assigned to &quot;vaibhav&quot; </span>which are not closed.<br>
              </li>
              <li><code> category:(pending,development) Assigned To:vaibhav </code><br>
                  <span style="MARGIN-LEFT:5mm">Search for requests in the &quot;pending&quot; or &quot;development&quot; category assigned to &quot;vaibhav&quot;.</span> <br>
              </li>
              <li><code> -stat:closed </code><br>
                  <span style="MARGIN-LEFT:5mm">List all requests that are not closed.</span><br>
              </li>
              <li><code>reqtype:(&quot;Interface Design&quot;) </code><br>
                  <span style="MARGIN-LEFT:5mm">List all requests with a category of &quot;Interface Design&quot;.</span><br>
              </li>
              <li><code>dueby:2006-31-01</code><br>

            </ul>
            <p>Most descriptors are common between IUCs and TQL, but there are a few which are specific to TQL:</p>

            <p>Although the general user need never know this, there are several ways in which 
                the request system can be customized for a Domain . A Domain might 
                define a number of <em>custom fields</em> (as in the Proprietary Domain ). Most Domains define a number of categories and request types 
                appropriate to the problem domain. Category Analysts are assigned to each 
                category, and for each category it is specified whether that person gets email, 
                and whether he or she is a <a href="#AutomaticAssignment">volunteer</a>. These 
                settings can be viewed by clicking <strong>View My Domain Profile</strong> on the <a href="#SettingsDialog">
                    Settings</a> page.            </p>
			<h4><a name="NewDomain"></a>Creating a New Domain </h4>
            <p>To create a new Domain , read through the information here about customizing Domains , and then refer to
                the worksheet for <a href="http://tBits/web/tBits-ba-setup.html">new Domains </a>.</p>
            <h4><a name="AdministratorsRoles"></a>Administrators and Roles
            </h4>
            <p>In tBits, there are several kinds of administrator.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong><a href="#WhatIsConfigurable">Administrator</a></strong><br>
                    The Domain administrator is indicated as an <em>Admin</em>
                in the interface. This kind of administrator can manage categories,
                Assigned To,  and roles of users within the Domain .</li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Permissions Administrator</strong><br>
                    The Permissions Administrator is indicated as a <em>PermissionAdmin</em>
                in the interface. This role has all the access of an Admin, and also has 
                read-only access to the full set of configurable parts of the Domain . A 
                Permission Administrator can also add or remove a Domain administrator.</li>
              <li><strong><a href="#ConfigurableBytBitsTeam">tBits Development Team</a></strong><br>
                The tBits development team can make any change in the Domain configuration. 
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>Access to the fields within a request and the permission to add or change them 
                are set based on the <strong>role</strong> of the user. More than one role can 
                apply; for instance, one could be both a Submitted By and an Assigned To. In that case, 
                the applicable permissions are a union of those allowed for all applicable 
                roles. The supported roles are given in increasing order of access to the 
                fields of a request.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>User</strong>: <strong></strong>
                A general user can add or modify few of the fields within a request.</li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Subscriber</strong>: A subscriber for a request. This is a 
                contextual role.</li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Submitted By</strong>: The Submitted By of a request. This is a contextual 
                role.</li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Assigned To</strong>: The Assigned To for a request. This is a contextual 
                    role. Only a <em>category Assigned To </em>
                can be assigned requests within the specified category.</li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Analyst</strong>: <strong></strong>
                An analyst in a Domain is authorized to act on requests in that Domain .</li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Admin</strong>: <strong></strong>
                This refers to the administrator role defined above.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Some roles are <em>contextual</em>: they are assigned based on the relationship 
                of the user to a particular request.</p>
            <p>A user can be defined to be an <em>analyst</em> for a Domain . As an 
                orthogonal concept to that, a <em>category Assigned To </em>is a possible <em>Assigned To</em>
                for various categories of the Domain . There is no access permission 
                associated with a category Assigned To, but there is with an Assigned To or an 
                analyst. The main difference within tBits is that an Assigned To is a contextual 
                role, and so an Assigned To has access to those requests already assigned to him 
                or her; the analyst has access to all requests in the Domain based on 
                the role of analyst. However, only a category Assigned To can be assigned a 
                request.</p>
            <h4><a name="WhatIsConfigurable"></a>What is Configurable by an Administrator
            </h4>
            <p>Note that only a few options can be set by the Domain Administrator; most 
                must be set by the  <a href="#ConfigurableBytBitsTeam">tBits development team</a>. 
                The Domain Administrator can only manage the categories, category 
                Assigned Tos, and analysts, and assign various roles to users of the Domain . These can be set from the <strong>Users</strong> and <strong>Manage</strong>
                views of the <strong>Admin</strong> interface.
There is a link to the Admin interface from the tBits Main page, as well as from the request details page. </p>
            <p>To add a user for a Domain , go to the <strong>Users</strong> view and 
                click on the <strong>Add User</strong> link.

            <h4><a name="ConfigurableBytBitsTeam"></a>What is Configurable by the tBits Development Team
            </h4>
            <p>Submit requests to the <a href="http://tBits.tbitsglobal.com/add-request/tBits" target="_blank">tBits
                    development team</a>  to
            make changes as described in this section. See also the section on <a href="#NewDomain">creating
            a new Domain </a>. </p>
            <p>The <strong>Admin</strong> page includes tabs for <strong>Properties</strong>, <strong>
                    Fields</strong>, <strong>Roles</strong>, <strong>Users</strong>, and <strong>Manage</strong>. 
                  Only the <strong>Users</strong> and <strong>Manage</strong> tabs can be changed 
                  by a business administrator; the others can be changed only by the tBits development team. 
                  The <strong>Properties</strong> tab is used to define most of the 
                  characteristics of a Domain . The <strong>Fields</strong> tab is used to 
                  define all the fields of a Domain . The <strong>Roles</strong> tab is 
                  used to specify what sorts of access different kinds of users have to the 
                  Domain ; for example, general users, loggers, and analysts. </p>
            <p>The mapping of mail severity levels to tBits status values can also be 
                customized for each Domain . For instance, an importance level of <strong>High</strong>
                in mail can map to a tBits severity of <strong>Critical</strong> or <strong>High</strong>.</p>
            <p>Any aspect of the set up of a Domain can be set through configurable 
                permissions. For example, a Domain can track fields internally in a 
                Domain , but not display them to general users, such as the time to 
                complete a task. An entire Domain can be set to be private, so that 
                access to the Domain is restricted to authorized users. Only the Submitted By, 
                Assigned To,  and Subscriber fields are not configurable.
            </p>
            <p>Custom fields can be added and new values for list type fields (such as Category and 
            Severity) can be specified for a Domain . </p>
            <p>The option to update fields of a request via email using <a href="#InlineUpdateCommands">
                    IUCs</a> can be configured for analysts for a Domain . The exact 
                descriptor syntax accepted can also be configured.
            </p>
            <p>If the field is a list type field, then the list types and their relative display order can be specified.  For each  value, the type can be specified 
                to be any of:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Final</strong>: A type marked as <strong>Final</strong>
                is a type which, once set, cannot be changed. Anyone can set a request to have 
                this type, but no one can change the field value after that. New requests 
                cannot be set to a final type. This type is shown in light grey in the search 
                results and request details pages.</li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Private</strong>: A type marked as <strong>Private</strong>
                can be viewed only by authorized users.</li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Active</strong>: A type is <strong>Active</strong> if it can be 
                    selected. If a type is to be retired from use, it cannot be deleted if any 
                    requests have been marked with that type. However, it can be made <strong>Inactive</strong>. 
                    In that case, new requests and updates to requests cannot be marked with that 
                    type.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>The <strong>Fields</strong> tab also shows values for the <strong>Field Tracking 
                    Display</strong> value. This refers to whether changes in that field value 
                are detailed within updates to a request. For example, the subscriber list is 
                not shown in the header, but it is tracked in the request in a light font:</p>
            <blockquote>
            <p>[ Subscribers: ritesh, sandeep, vineet] 
            </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>The <strong>Regex</strong> field can be used for a custom field to restrict 
                field values to those that matched the specified Perl regular expression.</p>
            <p>The <strong>Description</strong> for the field or the type is only used 
                internally; it is not displayed to general users in the tBits interface.
            </p>
            <h4><a name="BusinessRules"></a>Business Rules
            </h4>
            <p>The Domain can be configured to follow business rules. Examples of 
                business rules are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                Pending requests cannot be closed.</li>
                <li>
                    Unassigned requests cannot be closed.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>In the case of a bulk request update, sometimes these business rules are 
                ignored.
            </p>
            <p>Business rules have been generalized with these definitions:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                Business Rule =&gt; [Condition]+ [Action]+</li>
                <li>
                    Action =&gt; [Validate Current State] | [Validate Transition] | [Modify to a 
                    different state]
                </li>
            </ol>
            <p>However, business rules and their effects are not visible to general users, and 
                so it is not encouraged to use them extensively in the Domains .
            </p>
            <p>If you believe you need a new business rule for a Domain you manage, 
                please contact the <a href="#ConfigurableBytBitsTeam">tBits development team</a>. </p>
            <h4><a name="DueDate"></a>Setting the Default and Allowed Due Dates</h4>
            <p>Overdue items are shown with indicators in the request interface and in the 
                requests. Additionally, the due dates of a Domain can be configured to 
                be mandatory, optional (with or without a default due date), or disabled.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>available/mandatory/set-by-default </strong>
                    <BR>
                    The due date is pre-populated with the default value specified in the Domain configuration. Users cannot clear the value in this field, so every 
                    request is associated with a due date.
                    <BR></li>
                <li>
                    <strong>available/optional /set-by-default </strong>
                    <BR>
                    The due date is pre-populated with the default value specified in the Domain configuration. Users are given the choice to clear the value in the field. 
                    If the due date is cleared, the request is not associated with any due date. 
                    Users can set or clear the value at any point during the lifetime of requests 
                    in this Domain .
                    <BR></li>
                <li>
                    <strong>available/optional /not-set-by-default</strong>
                    <BR>
                    The due date is empty by default. Users can choose to specify a due date to 
                    associate with a request. The due date can be set or cleared at any point 
                    during the lifetime of requests in this Domain .
                    <BR></li>
                <li>
                    <strong>unavailable</strong>
                    <BR>
                    The due date field is not shown when submitting or updating a request.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Only the tBits development team has change permission for the due date field.
            </p>
            <p>
                If the Domain 's due date configuration option is changed to mandatory 
                (the first option above) and if the due date is null, then the first time a 
                person authorized to change the due date subsequently appends to the request, 
                he or she <em>must</em> enter a due date. The Domain can be configured 
                to use just a date, without a time, or to use a date and time.
            </p>
            <p>If the due date configuration is one of the optional configurations, then in the 
                Add Request page and the Update Request page there is a <strong>Clear/Set Default</strong>
                label next to the Due Date.
            </p>
            <h4><a name="NotificationRules"></a>Enhanced Email Notification Settings</h4>
            <p>The administrator for a Domain can configure the  email notification settings for each list type field separately. There can be an email 
                notification setting for each Category, Severity, Request Type, and Status in 
                the Domain . For example, you can set it up so that someone gets mail for 
                all requests with Critical Severity.
            </p>
            <p>Additionally, there is the ability to define calendars (e.g. &quot;Outside Singapore Helpdesk 
                hours&quot;) to allow different notification rules during the day versus off-hours. 
                Explanations of the calendar options and a list of holidays are
                available by clicking on the <strong>calendar definitions</strong> link on the Admin page.  Contact the <a href="#ConfigurableBytBitsTeam">tBits development team</a> to define a custom calendar.
            </p>
            <h4><a name="MailingListsForConfiguring"></a>Configuring Analysts Using Mailing 
                Lists</h4>
            <p>A Domain can be configured using a mailing list to specify the analysts 
                and the category Assigned To for the Domain rather than listing
              each  individual. As a result, when employees join and leave a
              project, updating the 
                mailing list is sufficient to update the Domain. However, differences
              in  configuration for individual analysts cannot be made if the
              Domain is 
                configured using a mailing list to specify the analysts.

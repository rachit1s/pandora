To Upgrade from previous version (6.0.31):
The main reason of upgrading is that the scheduled jobs are no longer kept in file. Instead these jobs are kept in database. So, we need to move the existing jobs to the database.

1. Keep a backup of the installed files.
2. Install a fresh version following the settings of previous installation.
3. Copy the old tbits-quartz-job.xml to the current installation. This file is available in ($INSTALL_PATH\build\etc).
4. Run the SQL named "tbits_quartz_sqlServer.sql" (available in $INSTALL_PATH\build\bin\db)
5. Now run the file "migratejobs2db.bat" (located in $INSTALL_PATH\build\bin\)

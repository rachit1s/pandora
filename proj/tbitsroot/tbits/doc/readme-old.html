		<h2>
		<a name="introduction">Introduction</a>
		</h2>
		<p>
		Thank you for choosing tBits, version 6.0. </p>

		<p>tBits is the next generation web-based issue tracking system that combines
		  the power of workflow, database systems, advanced searching technology
		  and the convenience of email systems.</p>

		<p>tBits, initially designed for bug tracking, has evolved to become a very
		  generic tool - essentially a simple database with a web front having
		  the capability to track the history of each row and field that can
		  be defined by the user. To effectively search the database, tBits comes
		  with its
		  own
		  search query language that can search even inside attachments like
		  pdf, doc, xls, ppt.</p>
		<p>The operations on the system can be performed either by using a browser
		  or an email client using defined grammar. The intelligence in the system
		  is given by a
		  powerful inbuilt Workflow Rule Engine and notification rules mechanism.</p>
		<h2>
		<a name="features">Features</a>

		<h2><a name="Getting"></a>Getting tBits</h2>
		The latest release is available <a href="installer.jar">here</a>.
		<h2>
		<a name="systemRequirements">System Requirements</a>
		</h2>
		
		<p>tBits uses Microsoft SQL Database. If you don't have MS SQL server installed,
		  please <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/sql/default.mspx">download the express
		  edition</a> which is free. JDK 1.5 or higher must be installed on
	  your system.</p>
		<h2><a name="Installation"></a>Installation</h2>
		<h3>Database Creation</h3>
		The Database can be created in any of the following ways:
		<h4>Attaching the database: </h4>
		Download the database located <a href="database.zip">here</a>. Unzip and attach.
		<h4>Using SQL Scripts</h4>
		Create a database named <strong>tbits</strong>. and create tables, stored procedures using the <A HREF="sql-scripts.zip">following scripts</A>.
		Execute the <strong>tbits_schema.sql</strong> first followed by <strong>tbits_data.sql</strong>.
		<h3>Running the installer</h3>
		Once you are done with the database creation, start the installer.jar by clicking
		on it or by using the command <strong>java -jar installer.jar</strong>.
		The installer wizard will take you to the following steps:
		<ul>
		<li><strong>Welcome Screen</strong></li>
		<p> Click 'Next'. </p>
		<li><strong>Message</strong></li>
		<p>Read the details carefully and click 'Next'.</p>
		<li><strong>License Agreement</strong></li>
		<p>Select 'I accept' and hit 'Next'.</p>
		<li><strong>JDK Path</strong><br></li>
		  <p>It is not path to JRE. Select the location where JDK is installed
		  and hit 'Next'.		</p>
		<li><strong>Installation Path</strong></li>
		<p>Select the installation path and hit 'Next'. This is the location where
		tBits gets installed. We will be referring to it as INSTALL_PATH.</p>
		<li><strong>Database Connection Parameters</strong></li>
		<p>Enter the name of database server which will be your machine name by default.
		Leave the database name filled with &quot;tbits&quot; (without quotes).
		In the User credentials section, input the user name (and its password)
		which will be used by tBits to connect to database. The admin credentials
		are not required since the installer doesn't create the database. In
		future	versions,
		the installer will create the database.
		</p>
		<li><strong>Domain Controller</strong></li>
		<p>This is  required if you want to use tBits to authenticate using Domain
		  Controller.	Since the default installation uses the tBits - Internal
		  authentication (A form based authentication), you can just ignore this
		  form and click
		'Next'.	</p>
		<p>In case you plan to integrate with Domain Controller, follow these steps: 
		<ol>
		<li>Specify  the name of the server which acts as the domain controller in
		  your network and the LDAP server which will be used for user synchronization. 
		<li>Change the authentication filter. Edit web.xml located in
  INSTALL_PATH/build/webapps/WEB-INF.  Uncomment the filter block that uses jcifs.http.NtlmHttpFilter
  and comment the filter block that uses the class transbit.tbits.authentication.AuthenticationFilter.
		  <li>Switch-on the LDAP account synchronization. Edit INSTALL_PATH/build/etc/tbits-quartz-jobs.xml
  and uncomment the job block with "AD2TBitsSync" as the job name. If you don't
  select this, you can still use the system but you will have to add accounts
  using
  the 'All Users' Tab in the Administration Panel of tBits.
  </ol>
  </p>
  <li><strong>SMTP Server</strong></li>
  <p>Since tBits would be sending mails to various emails ids, you need to configure
		an outgoing mail server. Type the name of SMTP server. If your server
  requires	authentication check "Requires Authentication" and provide the login
  name and password. </p>
  <p>NOTE: If your SMTP Server does not accept connections at
    25 port,
		  the installer will not proceed. 
		  In such a case, just specify any mail server which accepts connections
		  at 25 port and change the settings 	by editing INSTALL_PATH/build/tbits.properties </p>
  <li><strong>tBits General Configuration</strong></li>
		<p>This is the general configuration which can be skipped. You might want to
		  change	the <strong>Notification Recipient  Mail Id</strong>.
		Click 'Next'.		</p>
		<li><strong>Installation of tBits - Packs</strong></li>
        <p>Just click 'Next'. This will install the tBits. It will take around
          five minutes.	
		This will be followed by the shortcut creation, just click 'Next' and
          you will	be done.		</p>
        </ul>
		<h2><a name="Configuration"></a>Configuration</h2>
		In case you have more requirements, for example, you want the attachments to
		be stored somewhere else, you would need to edit the configuration. The
		configuration	files located in the INSTALL_PATH/build/etc folder are
		self	descriptive.	
		The templates are located in INSTALL_PATH/build/web. You might want to
		put the logo of your company at the main screen.
		
		<h2>
		<a name="launch"></a>Launching tBits
		</h2>
		The Installer must have created the shortcuts on the desktop. Double click
		on "Start
		tBits Server" icon and it will start tomcat hosting tBits as well as the scheduler
		which executes the jobs.	Once tomcat starts, double click on the "tBits" shortcut
		located on the desktop.  It will prompt you to enter the login name and
		password.	Just enter 'root' (without quotes) as login and 'root' (without
		quotes)	as	password.

		or on 'Help' located at the top right on the tBits main screen.
